<h1>THE FLUTE OF THE GODS</h1>
<hr class='pb' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_v' name='page_v'></a>v</span></div>
<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>In romances of the aborigines of the so-called New
World there is usually presented savage man or
woman modified as may be by the influence of European
mythologies in various authorized forms. But,
certain people of this New World possessed at least
a semi-civilization centuries before the coming of
white conquerors.</p>
<p>When man ceases to be nomadic, builds houses of
stone and mortar, terrace upon terrace,&ndash;&ndash;walled and
fortressed against the enemy,&ndash;&ndash;when he has fields of
growing grain, textile fabrics, decorated pottery, a
government that is a republic, a priesthood trained in
complex ritual, a well stocked pantheon, a certain
understanding of astronomy and psychic phenomena,
he may withal be called barbarian, even
as was Abraham on Moriah barbaric when the altar
of his god called for sacrifice of his only son. But a
people of such culture could not with truth be called
savage.</p>
<p>The tale told here has to do with these same historic
barbarians. That there is more of depth to the
background of American Indian life than is usually
suggested by historians has been made clear of two
tribes by Dr. Le Plongeon in his <i>Sacred Mysteries of
the Mayas and Quiches 11500 Years Ago</i>. Similar
mysteries and secret orders exist to-day in the tribes
of the Mexicos and Arizona. In certain instances
the names and meanings of offices identical with those
of Yucatan survive, to prove an ancient intercourse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_vi' name='page_vi'></a>vi</span>
between the Mayan tribes and those who now dwell
in the valley of the Rio Grande. The Abbe Clavigero
left account of a thousand years of the history
of one tribe as transcribed by him from their own
hieroglyphic records. Lord Kingsborough may have
been far astray with his theory that the people of
America were the Lost Tribes of Israel, but the researches
embodied in his remarkable <i>Antiquities of
Mexico</i>, demonstrated the fact that they were not a
people of yesterday.</p>
<p>As to historic notes used in this tale of the more
northern Sun worshipers: Cabeza de Vaca, the first
European to cross the land from the Mississippi to
Mexico (1528-1536), left record in Spanish archives
of Don Teo the Greek. Caste&ntilde;ada, historian for the
Coronado expedition (1540-1542), left reluctant
testimony of the worse than weird night in one Indian
town of the Rio Grande, when impress was left
on the native mind that the strong god of the white
conquerors demanded much of human sacrifice. In
that journal is record also of the devoted Fray
Luis, of whose end only the Indians know. In
<i>Soldiers of the Cross</i> by Archbishop Salpointe, there
is an account of a god-offering made in 1680 (after almost
a century of European influences), warranting
the chapter describing a similar sacrifice on the same
shrine when the pagan mind was yet supreme and the
call of the primitive gods a vital thing.</p>
<p>It is yet so vital that neither imported government
nor imported creeds have quite stamped it out. Only
the death of the elders and the breaking up of the
clans can eradicate it. When that is done, the Latin
and the Anglo-Saxon will have swept from the heart
of the land, primitive, conservative cults ancient as
the Druids.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_vii' name='page_vii'></a>vii</span></div>
<p>With thanks to the Indian friends who have helped
me, I desire especially to express my obligation to
Edward S. Curtis, whose wonderful volumes of <i>The
North American Indian</i> have been an inspiration, and
whose Indian pictures for this book of mine possess
a solid value in art and ethnology far beyond the
mere illustration of text.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE WOMAN FROM THE SOUTH</h3>
</div>
<p>Aliksai! In Tusayan the people were living!
It was the year after the year when the
great star with the belt of fire reached across
the sky. (1528.)</p>
<p>The desert land of the Hopi people stretched yellow
and brown and dead from mesa to mesa. The
sage was the color of the dust, and the brazen sky
was as a shield made hard and dry by the will of the
angry gods. The Spirit People of the elements could
not find their way past that shield, and could not bear
blessings to Earth children.</p>
<p>The rain did not walk on the earth in those days,
and the corn stood still, and old men of the mesa towns
knew that the starving time was close. In the kivas
fasted the Hopi priests, the youth planted prayer
plumes by the shrines of the dying wells, and the
woman danced dances at sunrise, and all sang the
prayers to the gods:&ndash;&ndash;and each day the store of corn
was lower, and the seed in the ground could not
grow.</p>
<p>In the one town of W&aacute;lpi there were those who regretted
the seed wasted in the planting,&ndash;&ndash;it were
better to have given it to the children, and even yet
they might find some of it if the sand was searched
carefully.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; said old Ho-tiwa, the Ancient of the
village, and the chief of Things of the Spirit. &ldquo;It
is not yet so bad as when I was a boy. In that starving
time, the robes of rabbit skins were eaten when
the corn was gone. Yet you see we did live and have
grown old! The good seed is in the ground, and
when the rain comes&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it comes!&rdquo; sighed one skeptic&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;We
wait one year now,&ndash;&ndash;how many more until we die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is that you die&ndash;&ndash;the rain or the no rain
makes no change&ndash;&ndash;you die!&rdquo; reminded the old man.
&ldquo;The reader of the stars and of the moon says a
change is to come. Tell the herald to call it from the
housetops. This night the moon is at the big circle&ndash;&ndash;it
may bring with it the smile of the glad god
again. Tell the people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as the herald proclaimed at the sunset the
hopeful words of the priests who prayed in the kivas,
old Ho-tiwa walked away from the spirit of discontent,
and down the trail to the ruins of Sik-yat-ki.
All the wells but that one of the ancient city were
useless, green, stagnant water now. And each day
it was watched lest it also go back into the sands, and
at the shrine beside it many prayers were planted.</p>
<p>So that was the place where he went for prayer
when his heart was heavy with the woe of his people.
And that was how he found that which was waiting
there to be found.</p>
<p>It was a girl, and she looked dead as she lay by the
stones of the old well. As he bent over to see if she
lived, the round moon came like a second sun into
the soft glow of the twilight, and as it touched the
face of the girl, the old man felt the wind of the
south pass over them. Always to the day he died
did he tell of how that south wind came as if from
swift wings!</p>

<p>He called to some men who were going home from
rabbit hunting in the dusk, and they came and looked
at the girl and at each other, and drew away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have our own women who may die soon,&rdquo;
they said: &ldquo;Why take in a stranger? Whence
comes she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one had seen her come, but her trail was from
the south. She wore the dress of a pueblo girl, but
she was not of their people. Her hair was not cut,
yet on her forehead she carried the mark of a soon-to-be
maternity&ndash;&ndash;the sacred sign of the pi&ntilde;on gum
seen by Ho-tiwa when he went as a boy for the seed
corn to the distant Te-hua people by the river of the
east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come here with prayer thoughts to the water,&rdquo;
said the old man noting their reluctance,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and I
find a work put by my feet. The reader of the skies
tells that a change is to come with the moon. It is
as the moon comes that I find her. The gods may
not be glad with us if our hearts are not good at this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the corn&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The corn I would eat can go to this girl for four
days. I am old, but for so long I will fast,&ndash;&ndash;and
maybe then the gods will send the change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the girl was carried to his house, and the women
shrank away, and were afraid&ndash;&ndash;for the clouds followed
the wind swiftly from the south, and the face
of the moon was covered, and at the turn of the night
was heard the voice of a man child&ndash;&ndash;new born of
the strange girl found by the well in the moonlight.
Ho-tiwa in the outer room of the dwelling heard the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
voice&ndash;&ndash;and more than the child voice, for on the
breath of the wind across the desert the good rain
came walking in beauty to the fields, and the glad
laughter of the people went up from the mesa, and
there was much patter of bare feet on the wet stone
floor of the heights&ndash;&ndash;and glad calls of joy that the
desert was to live again!</p>
<p>And within the room of the new birth the women
stared in affright at the child and at each other, for it
was most wonderfully fair&ndash;&ndash;not like any child ever
seen. This child had hair like the night, eyes like
the blue of the sky, and face like the dawn.</p>
<p>One man among them was very old, and in his
youth had known the Te-hua words. When the girl
spoke he listened, and told the thing she said, and the
women shrank from her when it was told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be a medicine-woman, for she knows
these things,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and these things are sacred
to her people. She says that the blade of a sacrifice
must mark her child, for the boy will not be a child
as other children.&rdquo; And at the mention of the knife
the people stared at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is such a knife,&rdquo; said Ho-tiwa. &ldquo;It belongs
to the Ancient Days, and only the gods, and
two men know it. It shall be as she says. The god
of the sky has brought the woman and has brought
the child, and on the face of the child is set the light
of the moon that the Hopi people will never again
doubt that the gods can do these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there was a council at which all the old men
talked through the night and the day. And while
they talked, the rain poured in a flood from the gray
sky, until men said this might be magic, for the
woman might have brought witchcraft.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></div>
<p>But the old chief said no evil craft could have
brought the good rain:&ndash;&ndash;The wind and the rain
had come from the south as the girl had come from
the south, and the light on the face of the child was
a symbol that it was sacred.</p>
<p>Then one man, who had been an Apache prisoner,
and found his way back, told of a strange thing;&ndash;&ndash;that
forty days to the south where the birds of the
green feathers were, a new people had come out of
the Eastern sea, and were white. The great kings
made sacrifices for them, and planted prayer plumes
before them&ndash;&ndash;for they were called the new gods
of the water and the sunrise.</p>
<p>And the girl had come from the south!</p>
<p>Yet another reminded the council that the words
of the girl were Te-hua words, and the Te-hua people
lived East of Ci-bo-la and Ah-ko&ndash;&ndash;the farthest east
of the stone house building people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since these are her only words, the child shall
be named in the way of that people,&rdquo; said Ho-tiwa.
&ldquo;The sacred fire was lit at the birth, and on the
fourth morning my woman will give the name in the
Te-hua way, and throw the fire to burn all evil from
his path, and the sacred corn will guard his sleep.
Some of you younger men never have heard of the
great Te-hau god. Tell it to them, Atoki, then they
will know why a Te-hua never sends away a poor
stranger who comes to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man who knew Te-hua words, and had seen
the wonderful Te-hua valley in his youth, sent smoke
from his ceremonial pipe to the four ways of the
gods, and then to the upper and nether worlds, and
spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Aliksai!</i> I will tell of the Te-hua god as it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
told to me by the old man of Kah-po in the time of
starving when I went with the men for the sacred
corn of the seed planting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing I tell is the true thing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was time for a god to walk on the earth, and
one was born of the pi&ntilde;on tree and a virgin who
rested under the shadow of its arms. The girl was
very poor, and her people were very poor; when the
pi&ntilde;on nut fell in her bosom, and the winds told her
a son was sent to her to rest beneath her heart, she
was very sad, for there was no food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wonderful things happened. The Spirits of
the Mountain brought to her home new and strange
food, and seeds to plant for harvest:&ndash;&ndash;new seeds
of the melon, and big seed of the corn:&ndash;&ndash;before
that time the seeds of the corn were little seeds.
When the child was born, strange things happened,
and the eagles fly high above till the sky was alive
with wings. The boy was very poor, and so much
a boy of dreams that he was the one to be laughed at
for the visions. But great wise thoughts grew out
of his mountain dreams, and he was so great a
wizard that the old men chose him for Po-Ahtun-ho,
which means Ruler of Things from the Beginning.
And the dreamer who had been born of the maid and
the pi&ntilde;on tree was the Ruler. He governed even the
boiling water from the heart of the hills, and taught
the people that the sickness was washed away by it.
His wisdom was beyond earth wisdom, and his
visions were true. The land of that people became
a great land, and they had many blue stones and
shells. Then it was that they became proud. One
day the god came as a stranger to their village:&ndash;&ndash;a
poor stranger, and they were not kind to him! The
proud hearts had grown to be hard hearts, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
only fine strangers would they talk with. He went
away from that people then. He said hard words
to them and went away. He went to the South to
live in a great home in the sea. When he comes back
they do not know, but some day he comes back,&ndash;&ndash;or
some night! He said he would come back to the
land when the stars mark the time when they repent,
and one night in seven the fire is lit on the hills by
the villages, that the earth-born god, Po-se-yemo, may
see it if he should come, and may see that his people
are faithful and are waiting for him to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of the day when the god came, and they
turned him away for that his robe was poor, and his
feet were bare;&ndash;&ndash;because of that day, no poor person
is turned hungry from the door of that people. And
the old men say this is because the god may come
any day from the South, and may come again as a
poor man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this was told to us by the Te-hua men when
we went for seed corn in that starving time, and were
not sent away empty. <i>Aliksai!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men drew long breaths of awe and approval
when the story was ended. The old man who had
found the girl knew that the girl had found friends.</p>
<p>But the mysterious coincidence of her coming as
the rain came&ndash;&ndash;and from the south&ndash;&ndash;and the fair
child!</p>
<p>Again the man who had been a prisoner with the
Apaches was asked to tell of the coming of the white
gods in the south where the Mexic people lived. He
knew but little. No Apache had seen them, but Indian
traders of feathers had said it was so.</p>
<p>The men smoked in silence and then one said:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Even
if it be so, could the girl come alone so far
through the country of the hostile people?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There is High Magic to help sometimes,&rdquo; reminded
the old chief. &ldquo;When magic has been used
only for sacred things it can do all things! We can
ask if she has known a white god such as the trader
told of to our enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the two oldest men went to the house of Ho-tiwa&rsquo;s
wife, and stood by the couch of the girl, and
they sprinkled sacred meal, and sat in prayer before
they spoke.</p>
<p>And the girl said, &ldquo;My name is Mo-wa-th&eacute; (Flash
Of Light) and the name of my son is Tahn-t&eacute; (Sunlight).
We may stay while these seeds grow into
grain, and into trees, and bear harvest. But not
always may we be with you, for a God of the Sky
may claim his son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she took three seeds from the fold of the
girdle she had worn. They were strange seeds of
another land.</p>
<p>The old men looked at each other, and remembered
that to the mother of the Te-hua god, strange seeds
had been given, and they trembled, and the man of
the Te-hau words spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come from the south where strange things
may happen. On the trail of that south, heard you
or saw you&ndash;&ndash;the white god?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she drew the child close, and looked in its
face, and said, &ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;a white god!&ndash;&ndash;the God of
the Great Star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the old men sprinkled the sacred meal to the
six points, and told the council, and no one was allowed
to question Mo-wa-th&eacute; ever again.</p>
<p>The seeds were planted near the well of Sik-yat-ki,
and grew there. One was the tree of the peach,
another of the yellow pear, and the grain was a grain
of the wheat. The pear tree and the wheat could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
not grow well in the sands of the desert, only enough
to bring seed again, but the peach grew in the shadow
of the mesa, and the people had great joy in it, and
only the men of the council knew they came from the
gods.</p>
<p>And so it was in the beginning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE DAY OF THE SIGN</h3>
</div>
<p>Mo-wa-th&eacute;,&ndash;&ndash;the mother of Tahn-t&eacute;,
drew with her brush of yucca fibre the
hair-like lines of black on the ceremonial
bowl she was decorating. Tahn-t&eacute;, slender, and
nude, watched closely the deft manipulations of the
crude tools;&ndash;&ndash;the medicine bowls for the sacred rites
were things of special interest to him&ndash;&ndash;for never in
the domestic arrangement of the homes of the terraces
did he see them used. He thought the serrated edges
better to look at than the smooth lines of the home
dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can I not know what is that put into them?&rdquo;
he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the Ancient Ruler and the medicine-men
know the sacred thing for &lsquo;Those Above.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wriggled like a beautiful bronze snake to the
door and lay there, his chin propped on his hands,
staring out across the plain&ndash;&ndash;six hundred feet below
their door&ndash;&ndash;only a narrow ledge&ndash;&ndash;scarcely
the length of the boy&rsquo;s body:&ndash;&ndash;divided the wall of
their home from the edge of the rock mesa.</p>
<p>Mo-wa-th&eacute; glanced at him from time to time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What thoughts do you think that you lie still like
a kiva snake with your eyes open?&rdquo; she said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think,&rdquo; he acknowledged with the gravity
of a ceremonial statement, &ldquo;These days I am thinking
thoughts&ndash;&ndash;and on a day I will tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;When a boy has but few summers his thoughts
are not yet his own,&rdquo; reminded Mo-wa-th&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are here&ndash;&ndash;and here!&rdquo; his slender brown
hand touched his head, and heart,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;How does any
other take them out&ndash;&ndash;with a knife? Are they not
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! The old men shall take you to the kiva
where all the youth of the clan must be taught how
to grow straight and think straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they teach me there whose son I am?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>Her head bent lower over the sacred bowl, but
she made no lines. He saw it, and crept closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I an arrow to you?&rdquo; he asked&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;sometimes
your face goes strange like that, and I feel like an
arrow,&ndash;&ndash;I would rather be a bird with only prayer
feathers for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled wistfully and shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a prayer;&ndash;&ndash;one prayer all alone,&rdquo; she
said at last. &ldquo;I cannot tell you that prayer, I only
live for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a white god prayer?&rdquo; he asked softly.</p>
<p>She put down the bowl and stared at him as at a
witch or a sorcerer;&ndash;&ndash;one who made her afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found at the shrine by the trail the head you
made of the white god,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;No one
knows who made it but me. I saw you. I am telling
not any one. I am thinking all days of that god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it the great god Po-se-yemo, who went
south?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Do you make the prayer
likeness that he may come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that he may come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother;&ndash;&ndash;you make him white!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I am whiter than the other boys;&ndash;&ndash;than all
the boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She picked up the bowl again and tried to draw
lines on it with her unsteady fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you talk more than all the boys,&rdquo; she observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the moon give me to you?&rdquo; he persisted.
&ldquo;Old Mowa says I am white because the moon
brought me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is ill luck to talk with that woman&ndash;&ndash;she has
the witch charm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I am Ruler, the witches must live in the
old dead cities if you do not like them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mo-wa-th&eacute; smiled at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when you are Ruler. How will you make
that happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these days I have been thinking the thoughts
how. If the moon brought me to you, that means
that my father was not like others;&ndash;&ndash;not like mesa
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;not like mesa men!&rdquo; she breathed softly.</p>
<p>Mo-wa-th&eacute; was very pretty and very slender.
Tahn-t&eacute; was always sure no other mother was so
pretty,&ndash;&ndash;and as she spoke now her dark eyes were
beautified by some memory,&ndash;&ndash;and the boy saw that
he was momentarily forgotten in some dream of her
own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one but me shall gather the wood for the
night fire to light Po-se-yemo back from the south
lands,&rdquo; he said as he rose to his feet and stood straight
and decided before his mother. &ldquo;The moon will
help me, and your white god will help me, and when
he sees the blaze and comes back, you will tell him
it was his son who kept the fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took from his girdle the downy feather of an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
eagle, stepped outside to the edge of the mesa and
with a breath sent it beyond him into space. A current
of air caught it and whirled it upwards in token
that the prayer was accepted by Those Above.</p>
<p>And inside the doorway, Mo-wa-th&eacute;, watching, let
fall the medicine bowl at this added evidence that an
enchanted day had come to the life of her son. Not
anything he wanted to see could be hidden from him
this day! Powerless, she knelt with bent head over
the fragments of the sacred vessel&ndash;&ndash;powerless
against the gods who veil things&ndash;&ndash;and who unveil
things!</p>
<p>It was the next morning that Mo-wa-th&eacute; stood at
the door of Ho-tiwa the Ancient one;&ndash;&ndash;the spiritual
head of the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come within,&rdquo; he said, and she passed his
daughters who were grinding corn between the stones,
and singing the grinding song of the sunrise hour.
They smiled at her as she passed, but with the smile
was a deference they did not show the ordinary neighbor
of the mesas in Hopi land.</p>
<p>The old man motioned her to a seat, and in silence
they were in the prayer which belongs to Those Above
when human things need counsel.</p>
<p>Through the prayer thoughts echoed the last thrilling
notes of the grinding songs at the triumph of
the sun over the clouds of the dusk and the night.</p>
<p>Mo-wa-th&eacute; smiled at the meaning of it. It was
well that the prayer had the music of gladness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I come early,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I come to see
you. The time is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time when I go. Always we have known
it would be some day. The day is near. I take my
son and go to his people.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter:&ndash;&ndash;his people he does not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father:&ndash;&ndash;no one but the winds have told
him&ndash;&ndash;yet he knows much! He has said to me the
things by which I feel that he knows unseen things.
I told him long ago that the stars as they touch the
far mesa in the night are like the fires our people
build to light our god back from the south. Yesterday
he tells me he wants to be the builder of that
fire and serve that god. My father in this strange
land:&ndash;&ndash;my son belongs to the clan whose duty it is
to guard that fire! I never told him. Those Above
have told him. I have waited for a sign. The gods
have sent it to me through my son&ndash;&ndash;we are to go
across the desert and find our people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a thing for council,&rdquo; decided her host.
&ldquo;The way is far to the big river,&ndash;&ndash;it is not good
that you go alone. Men of Ah-ko will come when
they hear us stamp the foot for the time of the gathering
of the snakes. When they come, we will make
a talk. If it is good that you go, you will find
brothers who will show the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is well;&rdquo; and Mo-wa-th&eacute; arose, and stood
before him. &ldquo;You have been my brother, and you
have been my father, and my son shall stay and see
once more the rain ceremony of the Blue Flute
people, and of the Snake people, and when he goes
to his own land, he can tell them of the great rain
magic of the Hopi Priests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can do more than that,&rdquo; said the Ancient.
&ldquo;In council it has been spoken. Your son can be
one of us, and the men of the Snake Order will be
as brothers to him if ever he comes back to the mesa
where the Sun Father and the Moon Mother first
looked on his face. In the days of the Lost Others,
all the people had Snake Power, as they had power
of silent speech with all the birds, and the four-foot
brothers of the forests. Only a few have not lost it,
and the Trues send all their Spirit People to work
with that few. Your son may take back to your
people the faith they knew in the ancient days.&rdquo;</p>

<span class='smcap'>The Prayer Token</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Page 13</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>So it was that the boy watched the drama of the
Flute people from the mesa edge for the last time.
The circle of praying priests at the sacred well;
virgins in white garments facing the path of the
cloud symbols that the rain might come;&ndash;&ndash;weird
notes of the flute as the chanters knelt facing the
medicine bowl and the sacred corn; then the coming
of the racers from the far fields with the great
green stalks of corn on their shoulders, and the gold
of the sunflowers in the twist of reeds circling their
brows. He did not know what the new land of his
mother&rsquo;s tribe would bring him, but he thought not
any prayer could be more beautiful than this glad
prayer to the gods. Of that prayer he talked to
Mo-wa-th&eacute;.</p>
<p>Then eight suns from that day, he went from his
mother&rsquo;s home to the kiva of the Snake Priests, and he
heard other prayers, and different prayers, and when
the sun was at the right height, for four days they
left the kiva in silence, and went to the desert for the
creeping brothers of the sands. To the four ways
they went, with prayers, and with digging-sticks. He
had wondered in the other days why the men never
spoke as they left the kiva, and as they came back
with their serpent messengers for the gods. After
the first snake was caught, and held aloft for the
blessing of the sun, he did not wonder.</p>
<p>He had shrunk, and thought it great magic when
the brief public ceremony of the Snake Order was
given before the awe-struck people:&ndash;&ndash;It had been a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
matter of amaze when he saw the men he knew as
gentle, kind men, holding the coiling snake of the rattles
to their hearts and dance with the flat heads
pressed against their painted cheeks.</p>
<p>But the eight days and nights in the kiva with these
nude, fasting, praying men, had taught him much,
and he learned that the most wonderful thing in the
taming of the serpents was not the thing to which
the people of the dance circle in the open were witness.
He was only a boy, yet he comprehended enough to
be awed by the strong magic of it.</p>
<p>And of that prayer of the serpents he talked not
at all to Mo-wa-th&eacute;.</p>
<p>And the Ancient knew it, and said. &ldquo;It is well!
May he be a great man&ndash;&ndash;and strong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a sheath of painted serpent skin the Ruler
drew a flute brown and smooth with age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&eacute;-lang-&ucirc;h, the God of the Flute sent me the
vision of this when I was a youth in prayer,&rdquo; he said
gently. &ldquo;I found it as you see it long after I had
become a man. On an ancient shrine uncovered by
the Four Winds in a wilderness I found it. I have
no son and I am old. I give it to you. Strange
white gods are coming to the earth in these days, and
in the south they have grown strong to master the
people. I will be with the Lost Others when you
are a man, but my words here you will not forget;&ndash;&ndash;the
magic of the sacred flute has been for ages the
music of the growing things in the Desert. The God
of the Flute is a god old as the planting of fields, and
a strong god of the desert places. It may be that
he is strong to lead you here once more to your
brothers on some day or some night&ndash;&ndash;and we will be
glad that you come again. For this I give the flute
of the vision to you. I have spoken. Lo-lo-mi!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>OF THE JOURNEY OF TAHN-T&Eacute;</h3>
</div>
<p>The journey of Tahn-t&eacute; to his mother&rsquo;s land
of the East was the wonder journey of the
world! There were medicine-men of Ah-ko
for their guides, and the people were many who
went along, so no one was afraid of the Navahu of
the hill land.</p>
<p>And a new name was given to his mother. Ho-tiwa
gave her the name, and put on her head the
water of the pagan baptism to wash away that which
had been. The new name was S[=aa]-hanh-que-ah and
it meant the &ldquo;Woman who has come out from the
mists of a Shadow or Twilight Land.&rdquo; And they
all called her by that name, and the men of Ah-ko
regarded her with awe and with respect, and listened
in silence when she spoke.</p>
<p>For the first time the boy saw beyond the sands of
the desert, and in the high lands touched the running
water of living springs, and scattered meal on it with
his prayers, and bathed in the stream where green
stems of rushes grew, and braided for himself a
wreath of the tasselled pine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ai-ai!</i>&rdquo; said his mother softly,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;to the people
of my land the pine is known as the first tree to come
from the Mother Earth at the edge of the ice robe
on her bosom. So say the ancients, and for that
reason is it sacred to the gods&ndash;&ndash;and to the sacrifices
of gods. Have you, my son, woven a crown of
sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></div>
<p>But Tahn-t&eacute; laughed, and thrust in it the scarlet
star blossom growing in the timber lands of the
Navahu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am made sacrifice I will have a blood strong,
living reason,&rdquo; he said, with the gay insolence of a
young god walking on the earth.</p>
<p>But the older men did not smile at the bright
picture he made with the blood-red stars in the green
of his crown. They knew that even untried youth
may speak prophet words, and they made prayers that
the wise woman of the twilight land might not see the
day when her son became that which he had spoken.</p>
<p>He carried with him a strange burden:&ndash;&ndash;an urn
or jar of ancient days dug from one of the buried
cities of the Hopi deserts. On it was the circle of
the plumed serpent, and the cross of red and of white.
It was borne on his back by a netted band of the
yucca fibre around his brow, and in it were young
peach trees, and pear trees&ndash;&ndash;the growing things
of the mystic seeds given to the medicine-men of the
Hopi the day of the boy&rsquo;s birth.</p>
<p>Seeds also were being carried, but it was the wish
of the mother that her son carry the growing things
into the great valley of the river P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute;.</p>
<p>Even into the great rift of the earth called Tz&eacute;-ye
did he carry it, where the cliff homes of the Ancient
Others lined the sides of the ca&ntilde;on and the medicine-men
of Ah-ko spoke in hushed tones because of the
echoing walls, and of the strong gods who had dwelt
there in the days before men lived and died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dead of the Ancient ones are hidden in many
hollow places of the stone,&rdquo; explained one of the men
who spoke the language of Te-hua people. &ldquo;And
it is good medicine for the man who can walk between
these walls where the Divine Ones of old made
themselves strong. You do not fear?&rdquo;</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not fear,&rdquo; said S[=aa]-hanh-que-ah, the woman
of the twilight, &ldquo;and my son does not fear. Before
he was born to the light of the Sun Father, I made the
trail from the level land of the west where the snow
is, to the deep heart of the world where the plants
have blossoms in winter time, and the birds sing for
summer. Beside it this deep step down from the
world above is like the thickness of your finger against
the height of a tall man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men stared at her in wonder, and Tahn-t&eacute;
listened, but could not speak when the older men
were silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is such a place,&rdquo; said the oldest of the men.
&ldquo;It is to the sunset. The water comes strong there,
and it is a place of the gods, as this place is. And
you have seen it with your eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen it, and the water that is so strong
looks from the top like this reed of this ancient
dwelling place,&rdquo; said S[=aa]-hanh-que-ah, and she pointed
to the waving slender lattice grass of the ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of it, but our people do not cross
it in these days,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Our friends
the Te-huas cross it&ndash;&ndash;and cross a desert beyond when
they go to the Love Dance of the Chinig-Chinik who
live by the sunset sea. In my youth I thought to go,
but old age is here and I have not yet seen it.&rdquo; Then
after an interval of thoughtful silence he said:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;You
have crossed that river in the heart of the
world&ndash;&ndash;I did not know that women went to the
Love Dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can not tell you. I also do not know,&rdquo; said
S[=aa]-hanh-que-ah quietly, and the boy saw that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
eyes of all the men were directed strangely to his
mother. &ldquo;I do not belong to the Order from which
the people are sent to the Dance of Love or the
Dance of Death. My eyes have not seen the waters
of the sunset sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you did not go beyond the river in the
heart of the rocks?&rdquo; asked the old man. &ldquo;You
did not cross over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did cross over. I have seen the sands of that
far desert of which you speak. I have seen the trees
of which one leaf will cover a man from the sun, and
more leaves will make a cover for a dwelling. I
have seen the water run there at the roots of those
trees as this water runs in the shadow of this rock,
and&ndash;&ndash;ai!&ndash;&ndash;ai-ah! I have seen it sink in the sands
when it was needed most&ndash;&ndash;and have heard it gurgle
its ghost laugh beneath the hot trail where the desert
lost one wandered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her head bent forward and her hands covered her
eyes. The boy wanted to ask where this place was
of which he was hearing so much for the first time.
What was there in the wonderful journey of the wise
woman to make the tears come and her voice tremble?
But the old Shaman of Ah-ko reached out his hand
and touched her bent head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, my daughter of the Te-hua, that the
Snake priest of the H&oacute;pit&ucirc; told in council that high
medicine was yours. Yet all he could not tell me.
You have lived much, oh woman! Yet your heart
is not hard, and your thoughts run clear as the snow
water of the high hills. It is well that you have
come with us, and that you have talked with us.
When the hidden water mocks with laughter so far
beneath the desert sand that no man lives to reach
it:&ndash;&ndash;then it is that men die beside the place their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
bleeding hands dig deep. You have heard that
laughter, and have lived, and have brought back your
child out of the sands of death. It has given you
the medicine for your son that is strong medicine.
You have lived to walk with us and that is well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thanks this day, it is well,&rdquo; said the other
men.</p>
<p>At Ah-ko, &ldquo;the city of the white rock,&rdquo; the silent,
shy Medicine-Woman of the Twilight and her son
were feasted like visiting rulers of a land.</p>
<p>To his wonder they sang songs of thanks that the
gods had let her come to them once again, and they
asked that she make prayers with them.</p>
<p>The woman with whom the rain and the sweet
fruit had come to the far desert was a woman to be
feasted and propitiated&ndash;&ndash;all the more that she disclaimed
aught of the divine for herself; but when
they spoke of her son she was silent. His life was
his own in which to prove what he might be.</p>
<p>Here he saw no girls with the head bands for their
burden of water bottles as in Tusayan. He saw instead
the beautifully poised vases on the heads of the
women while they paced evenly over the rock of the
mesa or the treacherous sand hills, and the great
walled reservoir of shining green water was a constant
source of delight to him. Eight times the height of
a man was the depth of it, and at the very bottom in
an unseen crevice was the living spring pulsing out its
heart for the long line of women who brought their
decorated jars to be filled.</p>
<p>The evening of their arrival he found his mother
there in the shadow of the high rock walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sad, my mother, that you walk alone
and sit in the shadow?&rdquo; he asked, but she shook her
head.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I come because this place of the deep water is
precious to me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Make your prayer here,
my son, make your prayer for the people who thirst
in the desert of this earth life. There are many
deserts to cross, and the enchanted hills and the enchanted
wells of content are but few on the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made the prayer, and scattered the sacred pollen
of the corn to the four ways, and again took up his
query.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The enchanted mesa Kat-zi-mo I have seen and
already the men have told me its story,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;But of this well there is no story except that in the
ages ago the water was brought high with the wall,
and when the Apache enemies came, the people could
not starve for water even while the fighters fought a
long time. That is all the story&ndash;&ndash;there is no magic
in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is always magic in the waters of the
desert,&rdquo; and the Woman of the Twilight. &ldquo;One other
time I drank of the water of this well. It was enchanted
that time, for every moving light and shadow
on its face have I remembered all the days and all the
nights. Give me to drink of it now with your own
hands, and it will be then precious for two reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did as she said, and wanted to ask of that other
time and could not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks this day, thanks for my son,&rdquo; she said
and sprinkled water to the four ways and drank.
&ldquo;Not again shall I see you&ndash;&ndash;oh joy place in the
desert! Give your magic to my son that he may
carry it to the free running water of his own land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Tusayan his mother had been to him Mo-wa-th&eacute;,
the pottery maker who made the finest of all vessels,
but on the wonder trail in the new lands he found that
she was strangely learned. And when she spoke of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
the place of the well on the high mesa and said it was
precious for magic there, he walked silent and awed
beside her, for the magic world held the Great
Mystery, and only through prayer must it be spoken.</p>
<p>He knew that his lot was more fortunate than that
of any other boy alive, an the long trail where each
night around the camp fire the men told tales of the
Ancient days when gods walked on the earth and
taught wisdom to the people. Each tribe had its own
sacred truths given by its own gods, and he was learning
of many. In the great ca&ntilde;on of Tz&eacute;-ye&ndash;&ndash;the
abiding place of the Navahu Divine Ones, he had
heard with awe of the warrior boy gods who were
born of the Sun and of the Goddess Estsan-atlehi and
set out to slay the terrific giants of evil in the world.
But the medicine-men of Ah-ko were quite sure that
the Ancient Ones of their own race had proof that the
Supreme Power is a master mind in a woman&rsquo;s form.
It is the thing which thinks and creates, and her twin
sister is the other mind which only remembers.
Prayers must not be said to the goddess who only
remembers&ndash;&ndash;but many prayers belong to the goddess
who creates. And the most belov&eacute;d of all is the
goddess E-yet-e-ko (Mother Earth) who nourishes
them all their days. He learned that they planted
their corn and their cotton by the stars and the plum
blossoms, in the way his mother said they did by the
river of her land, also that the great bear of the stars
was called by them the great animal of cold weather,
and that the Sun had eight children, or wandering
stars in the sky.</p>
<p>He heard many more things, but the wisdom of it
was too deep for a boy to know, and the words of the
symbols were new, and not for his understanding.
How big&ndash;&ndash;how very big the world of the Tusayan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
desert had seemed to him as he stood on the mesa of
W&aacute;lpi and looked to the south where old Awatabi
(the high place of the Bow) stood in its pride, and
rugged Mishongnavi with her younger sister Shupaulevi
against the sky, so beautiful, that the sacred
mountain Dok-os-lid of the far away, looks sometimes
like a cloud back of those villages, and sometimes like
the shell of the big water from which its name was
taken.</p>
<p>But all those wonderful Hopi mesas with their
fortresses on each, were within the running time of a
morning, and not in any of them were there forests
or living streams, or strange new things. Only the
clouds and the shadow of the clouds on the sand,&ndash;&ndash;or
the sun and the glory of the sun on the world, made
the heart leap with the beauty of the land of the Hopi
people. But here were new things each day.</p>
<p>When the boys of Ah-ko in friendly rivalry ran races
and leaped great spaces, and shot arrows into a melon
with him&ndash;&ndash;and then ate the melon!&ndash;&ndash;they asked
how many years he had lived and he laughed and did
not know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had so many,&rdquo; he said holding up the fingers of
both hands and pointing to his eyes,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;When I followed
your men down the trail from W&aacute;lpi in Hopi
land. But I have seen so much, and lived so much
that I must be very old now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This the boys thought a great jest, and said since
he was old he could not run races, or see straight to
shoot, and he must let himself be beaten. But the
boys who tried to beat him were laughed at by the
old men who watched, and he was given a very fine
bow to take on his journey, and never any boy crossed
those lands so joyously as he who carried all the way
the growing sprouts of the new trees.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>And at Ah-ko a little tree from the urn, and some
of the seeds were given, but the winter to come was a
hard winter, and the ice killed them, so the fruit from
the strange far-off trails was not for Ah-ko.</p>
<p>They had rested, and were about to depart, when
Tahn-t&eacute;, watching with other boys the war between
two eagles poised high above the enchanted mesa, saw
on the plain far below the figure of an Indian runner,
his body a dark moving line against the yellow bloom
spread like a great blanket of flowers from Mount
Spin-eh down and across the land.</p>
<p>He only watched because the man ran well&ndash;&ndash;almost
as well as a Hopi&ndash;&ndash;and did not see in the
glistening bronze body the herald of a new day in the
land.</p>
<p>At the edge of the cliff they watched to see him
appear and disappear in the length of the great stairway
of the fortress. Some day each boy among them
would also be a runner in his turn for ceremonial
reasons, and it is well to note how the trusted men
make the finish.</p>
<p>It is not easy to run up the two hundred foot wall
of Ah-ko at the end of a long trail, but this man,
conscious of watchers, leaped the last few steps and
stood among them. Only an instant he halted, in
surprise face to face with the boy Tahn-t&eacute; who stood
nude and fair beside dark companions.</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; was accustomed to the curious regard of
strangers who visited the country of Tusayan. He
had heard so often that he was a child of the sky that
this explanation of his fairer skin seemed to him a
very clear and logical explanation of the case.</p>
<p>But after the runner had been listened to by the
governor and fed, and a herald from the terraced
housetop had called aloud the startling message
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
brought by him to the people of Ah-ko, the boy went
away from the other boys, and wrinkled his brows
in boyish thought, and stared across to the ancient
crater of Se-po-chineh until his mother sought him,
and found him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are weary, my son, that you come alone
from the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others only talk yet tell nothing,&rdquo; he said
gloomily, &ldquo;and of that which the runner tells I wish
to hear much. You hear what he says of white men
like gods who come from the south searching for the
blue stones and the stone of the sun fire, and taming
strange beasts to carry them on their way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is true, I hear,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think it is magic? Is it that they are
gods&ndash;&ndash;or demons&ndash;&ndash;or men like these men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they were gods would they not know where the
stones of the sunlight are hidden in the earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they children of the moon or the sun, or the
stars that they are white?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; she said very lowly, conscious that
his gloomy eyes were trying to make her see what he
felt, but she must not see, and she spoke with averted
head.</p>
<p>Then he rose and stood erect and stretched out his
arms their widest and surveyed himself with measuring
gaze and a certain pride, but the other thought
came back with its gloom and he laughed shortly with
disdain of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have felt stronger than all the boys&ndash;&ndash;always!
Do you know why that has been? I know now why&ndash;&ndash;it
was because I stood alone,&ndash;&ndash;I was the only
child of the light and I dreamed things of that.
Now a man tells us there are many such people, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
their magic is great, and my strength goes because of
the many!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother stroked his hand reassuringly. &ldquo;Na-vin
(my own),&rdquo; she said steadily. &ldquo;I have felt your
dreams, and I also dream them. Fear no one born
of the light or of the darkness, and when you are a
man you will have all your strength&ndash;&ndash;and more than
your own strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that, my mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held her head erect now and looked straight
and steadily into the eyes of her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he remembered that it was more than his
mother who spoke, it was the Medicine Woman of the
Twilight and of the strange places, and the far off
thoughts.</p>
<p>He lifted her hand and breathed on it. &ldquo;I am
again Tahn-t&eacute;,&rdquo; he said, and smiled. &ldquo;You make
me find myself!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>WHITE SEEKERS OF TREASURE</h3>
</div>
<p>When Alvarado marched his band of adventurers
into the pueblo Ua-lano to the
sound of tom-toms and flutes of welcome,
an Indian woman with a slender boy stood by the
gate and watched the welcome of the strangers.</p>
<p>An exceedingly reckless, rakish lot they were&ndash;&ndash;this
flower of the Mexican forces who the Viceroy
was only too willing should explore all lands, and seas,
so they kept themselves away from the capitol.</p>
<p>The women and the children shrank back as the
horses clattered in. Some laughed to cover their
fear, others threw prayer meal, and their fright made
the commander notice the blanketed figure of the
woman whose eyes alone shone above the draperies
held close, and who stared so keenly into each white
face as they passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the dame in the mask of the blanket?&rdquo;
he asked of his host Chief Bigotes&ndash;&ndash;the courteous
barbarian who had crossed seventy leagues of the
desert to ask that his village be honored by the god-like
ones from the south.</p>
<p>Bigotes looked at her, did not know, but after inquiring
came back and spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a strange thing but it is true,&rdquo; said the interpreter,
&ldquo;she is called the One from the Twilight
Land. She went as a girl from Te-hua to Ah-ko for
study with the medicine people of one order there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
One night it was as if she go into the earth, or up in
the sky. No one ever see her any more. It was the
year of the fire of the star across the sky. Now she
comes from the west and so great a medicine woman
is she that leading men are sent to guard her on the
trail to the Te-hua people&ndash;&ndash;and to guard her son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith! Your strangers are a handsome pair.
The boy would make a fine page in a civilized land.
He is the fairest Indian I&rsquo;ve seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy knew that his mother and himself were
objects of query, and stood stolid, erect and disdainful,&ndash;&ndash;the
stranger should see that all their clanking
iron, their dominating swagger, and their trained animals
could not make him move an eyelash of wonder.</p>
<p>But to his mother he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have much that we will need if we ever
fight them; their clanking clothes and shields can
break many arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you talk of fighting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know why. It is all I thought of as I
looked at them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thing interested him more than all else, and
that was a man in a grey robe who carried a book, and
turned the pages in absorbed meditation; sometimes
his reading was half aloud, and Tahn-t&eacute; slipped near
each time he could, for to him it looked as if the man
talked to the strange white paper.&ndash;&ndash;He thought it
must be some sort of high magic, and of all he saw
in the new comers, he coveted most of the contents of
those pages,&ndash;&ndash;it was more wonderful than the clanging
metal of their equipment.</p>
<p>A tiny elf-like girl followed Tahn-t&eacute; as a lost puppy
would, until he asked her name, and was told it was
Yahn&ndash;&ndash;that she lived in Povi-whah by the big river
and that her mother was visiting some society of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
which she was a member,&ndash;&ndash;that she was in the kiva
and could not be seen for four days and nights, and in
the coming of the beasts and the strangers, her caretaker
had lost her, and the home where she had stayed
last night she did not know.</p>
<p>She knew only she was lost, and some boys had
told her that the new kind of beasts ate little girls.
She did not weep or call, but she tried to keep her
little nude body out of sight behind Tahn-t&eacute; if a horse
or a mule turned its head in the direction she was.</p>
<p>So glad she was to be protected that she told him
all her woes in the strange town. The greatest was
that a dog had taken from her hand the roasted ear of
corn she had been eating, and she wished Ka-yemo
was there, he would have maybe killed the dog.</p>
<p>Inquiry disclosed the fact that Ka-yemo was not her
brother; he lived in Provi-whah. Her own name was
Yahn. No:&ndash;&ndash;it was not a Te-hua name. It was
Apache, for her mother was Apache&ndash;&ndash;and the Te-hua
men had caught her when they were hunting, and
always her mother had told Yahn to stay close to the
houses, for hunting enemies might bear her away into
slavery&ndash;&ndash;and Yahn was not certain but these men on
the beasts might be hunters.</p>
<p>She was very tiny, and she spoke imperfectly, but
shyness was not a part of her small personality, and
she insisted on making herself understood. To
Tahn-t&eacute; she seemed like a boy rather than a girl, and
he called her Pa-ah-d&eacute; which is the Te-hna word for
&ldquo;brother&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and later he gave her to his mother to
keep her out of the way of the horses and the strange
men.</p>
<p>And thus it was that Tahn-t&eacute;, and Apache Yahn
saw together the strange visitors from the south, and
Yahn, though but a baby, thought they might be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
hunters whom it would be as well to hide from, and
Tahn-t&eacute; thought much of the coats of mail, and how
lances could be made to pierce the joints.</p>
<p>He heard the name of the man with the black robe
and the magic thing of white leaves from which he
talked&ndash;&ndash;or which talked to him!&ndash;&ndash;it was &ldquo;Padre&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;there
was also another name and it was &ldquo;Luis.&rdquo;
It meant the same as &ldquo;Father Ho-tiwa&rdquo; or &ldquo;Brother
Tahn-t&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the man from whom the rakish Spanish soldiers
bent the knee and removed the covering from the
head, Tahn-t&eacute; felt no antagonism as he did for the
men who carried the arquebus and swords. The
man who is called &ldquo;Father&rdquo; or the woman who is
called &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; with the Indian people, is a person
to whom respect is due, and through Bigote he had
heard&ndash;&ndash;by keeping quiet as a desert snake against a
wall&ndash;&ndash;that the man of the grey robe who was called
&ldquo;Father&rdquo; was the great medicine-man of the white
tribe. Through him the god of the white man spoke.
In the leaves of the white book were recorded this
god&rsquo;s laws, and even these white men who were half
gods, and had conquered worlds beyond the big
water of the South, and of the East, bent their knees
when the man of the robe spoke of the sacred
things.</p>
<p>Of these things he spoke to his mother, and was
amazed to learn that she knew of the white man&rsquo;s
gods, and the white men&rsquo;s goddess. Never had she
talked to him of this, and she did not talk to him much
now. She only told him that all she knew would belong
to him when the time came, and that the time
seemed coming fast&ndash;&ndash;but it was not yet. When he
was older he could know.</p>
<p>When he talked to her of the many white pages in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
which the white god had written, she told him that
much wisdom&ndash;&ndash;and strong magic must be there.
The white men had no doubt stolen for their earth-born
god the birth story of Po-se-yemo, the god of her
own people. But his magic had been great in that
land across the seas and that people had written words
of the earth-born god as had certain tribes of Mexico,
and all that the god said and did had been written
plainly as had been written the records of Quetzel-coatle
of the South, and it was not good that their own
tribe had not the written records of their gods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be that the time has come to make such
records,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;, &ldquo;our people should not be
behind the other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no written words,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;said his mother;&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;our
head men who govern have only the deerskin
writings of Ki-pah the wise, who lived long ago and
did much for the people of Kah-po and Oj-ke, and the
people of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of him I have not heard,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;was
he a god?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;no god, but he lived and worked as a god.
He came to this land before the day of my grandfathers.
When the time is come, the men of my
father&rsquo;s people will tell you the work he did in our
valley, and what he said. So will tell you the old
men of Provi-whah and the old men of Kah-po. He
came to a land, not to one people, and on the deerskin
he painted things never seen but by the wise men who
know how to read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy stared moodily into the sun swept court of
Ua-lano. There were so many things in the world of
which no one had ever told him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am very good, and say very many prayers,
and wait on the gods very carefully, will the wise men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
of the medicine orders tell me of the deerskin records
some day?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day&ndash;&ndash;it may be so,&rdquo; she conceded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! I will think of that each day as the sun
comes up!&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;And the magic of the white
man&rsquo;s writings I will learn for myself. It is a thing
which is not kept for sacred places, and no prayers are
needed for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman of mystery regarded him strangely, yet
spoke no word. The magic of the white conquerors
was wonderful magic to her, yet she could not ask
her son why he only spoke of them as ever beyond
some wall which they must not cross,&ndash;&ndash;and of their
knowledge as strong knowledge, yet not sacred knowledge.</p>
<p>Between the woman and her son there was often a
wall of silence. Even her love could not cross it.
There were always spoken or unspoken questions
which she left without answers. He was only learning
this in the wonderful journey of the desert lands,
and he asked fewer questions,&ndash;&ndash;but looked at her
more. And:&ndash;&ndash;she knew that also!</p>
<p>The man of the talking white leaves, and the grey
gown set in the center of the court a white cross, and
all the soldiers knelt, and in front of the dwellings the
brown people knelt also&ndash;&ndash;which the Christians
deemed a special dispensation that so many heathen
had been brought so quickly to their knees at the
mere sight of the holy symbol. And in the morning
Father Luis decided he would baptize all of them,
and have a high mass for the salvation of their souls.
The boy who watched the book so closely, was, he
felt sure, a convert at mere sight of the white leaves,
and the heathen mother would no doubt clamor also
for sanctification.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>But in the early dusk of the morning the boy and
his mother were on the trail for the home valley of the
river P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute; of which he had dreamed. With
them were people of Kah-po, and people of Provi-whah
and the Apache woman and her child Yahn.
Yahn made some one carry her most of the hard
trails, and talked much, and asked many things of the
little growing trees in the old urn of ancient Tusayan.</p>
<p>And when they came in sight of the sacred mesa,
Tuyo, a runner was sent ahead to tell the governor
and the head men of the strange new people of the
clanking iron at Ua-lano, and the wonderful and belated
home-coming of the lost woman of many years&rsquo;
mystery.</p>
<p>Because of this they were met at the edge of the
mesa by many, and the Woman of the Twilight knelt
and touched the feet of the governor and asked that
the gate of the valley be open to her and to her son.
And Tahn-t&eacute; knelt also and offered the growing
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are sacred things of which the Ruler must
speak,&rdquo; said the governor. &ldquo;I am but for one short
summer and winter, but the Ruler is for always. Of
the new things to bear fruit we still speak in council,&ndash;&ndash;also
of the new people trading a new white god for
blue stones, and painted robes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tahn-t&eacute; knew that a welcome was theirs, for
the governor would not have come outside the walls
except it had been so, and the old man watched keenly
the delight of the boy as the river of that land came
clear before him spread at the foot of the wide table
land, and the great plain below. Trees grew there,
and between them the running water shone in the sun.
The Black Mesa Tuyo, Mesa of the Hearts, arose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
from the water edge,&ndash;&ndash;a great dark monument of
mystic rites, and wondrous records of the time when it
had been a breathing place for the Powers in the heart
of the earth. The rocks were burned so red it always
seemed that the fire was still under them. And south
was the God-Maid mesa:&ndash;&ndash;its outline as the face of
a maid upturned to the sky.</p>
<p>Beyond the river stretched the yellow corn fields&ndash;&ndash;the
higher land like a rugged red skeleton from which
the soil had been washed,&ndash;&ndash;and beyond that was the
great uplift of the pine-clad mountains where the
springs never failed, and the deer were many.</p>
<p>Wild fowl fluttered and dove in the waters of the
river, grey pigeons flew in little groups from the trail;
as they walked, two men in canoes caught fish where
a little stream joined the big water of P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;in
every direction the boy was conscious of a richer, fuller
life than any he had yet seen. His mother was right&ndash;&ndash;her
people were a strong people! and their villages
were many in the valleys of the river.</p>
<p>In Povi-whah the clan of the Arrow Stone people
welcomed the Twilight Woman as their own, and the
men and women who had journeyed with her from
Ua-lano looked glad to have journeyed with her,&ndash;&ndash;they
had to answer many questions.</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; also had much practise in the Te-hua
words when he tried to tell them what the peach
was like, and what the pear was like, and the youth
were skeptical as to peaches big as six plums.</p>
<p>A boy larger than he flipped with a willow wand
at the urn with the little trees, and told him that in
Provi-whah a boy was whipped if he lied too often!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many times may a boy lie and not be
whipped?&rdquo; asked Tahn-t&eacute;, and the other boys
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
laughed, and one stripling gave him a fillet of otter
skin in approval, and said his name was Po-tzah, and
that their clan was the same.</p>
<p>But the tiny Yahn who looked from face to face,
and saw the anger in the face of the boy of the willow
wand, caught the switch and brought it down with all
the force of her two chubby arms on the nurslings
brought from Hopi land.</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; caught her and lifted her beyond reach of
the urn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have let the strange beasts of the iron
men eat you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You shall go hungry for
peaches if you kill the trees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others laughed as she wriggled clear&ndash;&ndash;and
lisped threats even while keeping out of range of his
strong hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always she is a little cat of the hills to fight for
Ka-yemo,&rdquo; said Po-tzah. &ldquo;Little Ka-yemo will
some day grow enough to fight alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ka-yemo scowled at them, and muttered things,
and sauntered away. He was the largest of all of
them, but one boy does not fight six!</p>
<p>Yahn was in such a silent rage that she twitched
and bent the willow until it was no longer any thing
but a limp wreck:&ndash;&ndash;she would break something!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the Apache!&rdquo; said Po-tzah. &ldquo;I think
that baby does not forget to fight even when she
sleeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little animal flung an epithet at him and ran
after the sulky Ka-yemo:&ndash;&ndash;evidently her hero and
idol.</p>
<p>The mother of Tahn-t&eacute; was called in council for
things of which Tahn-t&eacute; was not to know. But he
learned that she was of the society of the Rulers:&ndash;&ndash;that
from which the spiritual head was selected when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
the Po-Ahtun-ho or Ruler no longer walked on the
earth.</p>
<p>After the council sacred meal was sprinkled on the
trees in the urn, and the priests of the order of Po-Ahtun
divided them between the Winter people, and the
Summer people, that it be proven which the care of
the new fruit would belong to for prayers, and each
planted them by their several signs in the sky. His
mother spoke to him when alone and told him he was
now to do a boy&rsquo;s work in the village, and his training
must begin for the ceremonies of high orders into
which the council wished him to enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To serve our people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes:&ndash;&ndash;it will be so&ndash;&ndash;to serve our people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since it is to be like that, may I also speak?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he
asked. &ldquo;May I not speak to the men who decide?
I have thought of this each day since Ua-lano.
At some time I must speak:&ndash;&ndash;is not this the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be the time,&rdquo; she assented. &ldquo;We will go
to the old men of the orders. It may be they will
listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All night they listened, and all night they talked,
and the old men looked at the mother strangely that
the son should speak the words of a man in council.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks that you let me speak,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Thanks! It is true what you hear of the white
gold-hunter&rsquo;s magic. It is strong. It is good that
we find out how it is strong. My mother tells you
how the Snake priests of Tusayan make me of their
order, so that I can know that magic for the rain
ceremony. In my hands also was given the Flute of
Prayer to the desert gods, and to know Hopi prayers
does not hurt me for a Te-hua:&ndash;&ndash;it is Te-hua prayers
my mother teaches me always! So it will not hurt me
to learn the magic of the men of iron. They are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
strong and they will be hard to fight. The grey
robe man is the man who teaches of their gods. He
teaches it from magic white leaves in his hand, on the
leaves there are words&ndash;&ndash;other iron men can talk
from them, but only the grey robe is the priest and
teaches. He would teach me if I would serve him&ndash;&ndash;then
I could have their magic with our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be evil magic,&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It tames the strange beasts as the Hopi prayers
tame the snakes,&rdquo; replied the boy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and every day
the beasts do work for these people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old men nodded assent&ndash;&ndash;it certainly must be
strong magic to do that!</p>
<p>But a man of the Tain-tsain clan arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This woman has been gone many moons on a
strange trail,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The son she brings back
to her clan speaks not as a youth speaks. It is as if
he has been very old and grows young again. It may
be magic&ndash;&ndash;and again it may be that he is half lost
in his mind and dreams the dreams of a man. It is
a new thing that men listen to a child in council.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then K[=a]-ye-fah the aged Po-Ahtun-ho made a
sign for silence, and sat with closed eyes, and it was
very quiet in the council until he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have brought a big thought out of the world
of the Spirit People, Phen-tza,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It has
been given to you to say, and that is well! It has
been given to me to see&ndash;&ndash;and I see with prayer.
When the God-thought is sent to earth people is it not
true that the child of dreams, or the man of dreams,
is the first to hear or to feel that thought? Was not
the earth-born god, Po-se-yemo, called a youth that
was foolish? Was he not laughed at by the clans
until he wept? Was he not made ashamed until out
of his pain there grew a wisdom greater than earth-wisdom?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
Let us think of these things, and let us
hear the words of the child who dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;even when half the
mind is gone, it may be gone only a little while on
the twilight trail to the Great Mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The life music comes in many ways,&rdquo; said K[=a]-ye-fah,
the Ruler. &ldquo;Many reeds grow under the summer
sun, but not in all of them do we hear the call of
the spirit people when the wild reed is fashioned for
the flute. The gods themselves grow the flutes of
High Mystery. This youth is only a reed by the
river to-day&ndash;&ndash;yet through such reed the gods may
send speech for our ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will listen,&rdquo; said the others. &ldquo;Let us hear
more of the men whose blankets are made of the hard
substance.&rdquo; And at this Tahn-t&eacute; again took courage
and spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These iron men say they are only on a hunting
trail&ndash;&ndash;they say they will not trouble the people&ndash;&ndash;that
is what their men say who speak for them! But
if one boy, or one man, could talk as they talk, you
men of Povi-whah would know better if they speak
straight. My mother has found the trail to her
people on the right day, and has brought me here.
I want to be the boy who learns that talk of the hunters
of the blue stones and sacred sun metal of the earth,
and then I can come back and tell it to the wise men
of my mother&rsquo;s people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you may not come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will ask all the Powers that I will come back.
My mother will pray also, and her prayers are
strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will pray also,&rdquo; said S[=aa]-hanh-que-ah.</p>
<p>The men smoked, and the boy watched them and
waited until K[=a]-ye-fah spoke.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That which the son of this wise woman says is to
be well thought of;&ndash;&ndash;it may be precious to us in days
not yet born of the sun. You who listen know that
we are living now in a day that was told of by Ki-pah
in the years of our Lost Others, and Ki-pah spoke as
the god Po-se-yemo spoke:&ndash;&ndash;he was given great
magic to see the years ahead of the years he lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; assented the governor&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;It was
when the people yet lived in the caves, and the water
went into the sands in that highland&ndash;&ndash;that is when
he came to our Lost Others&ndash;&ndash;Ki-pah&ndash;&ndash;the great
wisdom. He came from the south, and taught them
to come down from the caves and build houses by the
great river, and to turn the water to the fields here.
All things worked with him&ndash;&ndash;and Kah-po&ndash;&ndash;and
Oj-ke and P[=o]-ho-g&eacute; were built and stand to this day
where he said they must be built. He knew all
speech, and could tell magic things from a bowl of
clear water. It was in the water he saw men who
were white, and who would cover the land if we were
not strong. These men are the men he saw in the
water. I think it is so, and that this is the time to be
strong.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>TAHN-T&Eacute; AMONG STRANGERS</h3>
</div>
<p>The one thing to which the boy gave awed
attention was that when the time came for
the villages to fight&ndash;&ndash;a leader would be
born to them&ndash;&ndash;if the people of the valley were true
to their gods they would be strong always, Ki-pah the
prophet told them to remember always the war star
in the sky&ndash;&ndash;the star Po-se-yemo had told them of,
when it moved, the time to make war would be here.</p>
<p>And when the time came to fight, a leader would
come to them, as he, Ki-pah had come! Because of
this thought was the heart of the boy thrilled that he
had been called a reed by the river&ndash;&ndash;a reed through
which music of the desert gods might speak.</p>
<p>He was filled with wild fancies of mystic things
born of these prophecies. And the old men said that
perhaps this was the time of which Po-se-yemo, the
god, and Ki-pah, the prophet, had told!</p>
<p>The vote of a Te-hua council has to be the agreement
of every man, and the star of the morning
brought dawn to the valley before the last reluctant
decided it was well to send a messenger to learn of the
strange gods.</p>
<p>But as the sun rose Tahn-t&eacute; bathed in the running
water of the river, and his prayer was of joy:&ndash;&ndash;for
he was to go!</p>
<p>In joy, and with the light of exaltation in his face
he said farewell to boy thoughts, and walked lightly
over the highlands and the valleys to Ua-lano, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
thence followed the adventurers to Ci-cu-y&eacute; and bent
the knee to Father Luis, and kissed the cross, and let
water be sprinkled over him, and did all the things
shown him with so glad a heart that the devoted priest
gave praise for such a convert from the pagan people.
So pleased was he with the eagerness of Tahn-t&eacute; to
learn, that he made him his own assistant at the ceremonies
of the Holy Faith.</p>
<p>And after each one, the boy washed his hands in
running water, and scattered prayer meal to the gods
of the elements, and to the Sun Father God, and knew
that in Provi-whah his mother was praying also that
he be not harmed by the god of the gold hunters&ndash;&ndash;and
that he come back strong with the white man&rsquo;s
magic.</p>
<p>The boy Ka-yemo of the Tain-tsain clan was also
sent&ndash;&ndash;but neither boy was told of the quest of the
other. The old men decided it was better so. Without
pay they went with the Spanish adventurers, one
serving the men of arms and learning the ways of the
strange animals, and the other serving the priests and
learning the symbols of the strangers&rsquo; creed of the
one goddess, and two gods, and many Go-h[=e]-yahs,
called saints by the men of the iron clothes.</p>
<p>They both saw many strange things in Ci-cu-y&eacute;, and
they saw the strange Indian slave, whom the old men
of Ci-cu-y&eacute; instructed to lead the men of iron
from their land with the romance of Quivera.
And the slave did it, and told the strangers of the
mythic land of gold and gems, and lost his life in the
end by doing so, but the life of the romance was more
enduring than any other thing, and the spirit of that
treasure search still broods over the deserts and the
mountains of that land.</p>
<p>But the stay of Ka-yemo was not even the length of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
the first winter with the strangers. For in Tiguex
where the great captain (Coronado) wintered, and
made his comfort by turning the natives out of their
houses, there was a season of grievous strife ere the
Spring came, and the two boys of Te-hua saw things
unspeakable as two hundred Indians of the valley,
captured under truce, were burned at the stake by the
soldiers of the cross.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for the crusade to the north as
written in the chronicles of Christian Mexico was to
save the souls of the heathen for the one god,&ndash;&ndash;and
his advocates were sending the said souls for judgement
as quickly as might be!</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; stood, pale and tense in the house where
the chapel of Fray Juan Padilla had been established,&ndash;&ndash;once
it had been the house of the governor of the
village who might even now be among the victims of
the broken trust.</p>
<p>On the altar was a crucifix in gold on ebony, and the
eyes of the boy were not kindly as he regarded it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They lie when they say you are a god of peace
like our god Po-se-yemo,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They lie when
they say you are the god of the red man&ndash;&ndash;you are
the white god of the white people&ndash;&ndash;and you will let
the red men hold not anything that your white children
want!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard himself speak the words aloud there alone
where the new altar was&ndash;&ndash;he seemed to hear himself
saying it over and over as if by the sound of his own
voice he could kill the sound of the tortured red men
in the court.</p>
<p>A blanketed figure ran in at the open door, halted
at the sound of Tahn-t&eacute;&rsquo;s voice&ndash;&ndash;and then flung
himself forward. It was Ka-yemo and his teeth were
chattering at the thought of the inferno without.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It may be they will not look for us here,&rdquo; he said
as he saw who it was in the chapel&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Perhaps&ndash;&ndash;if
one keeps near&ndash;&ndash;to their strong god: and you are
close also&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stay close because it is my work,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;said
Tahn-t&eacute;. &ldquo;Some of the men tied to the stakes out
there bent before their strong god and said prayers
there.&ndash;&ndash;Did it save them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will kill us&ndash;&ndash;we will never see our people&ndash;&ndash;they
will kill us!&rdquo; muttered Ka-yemo shaken with
fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think they want to kill us:&ndash;&ndash;they still
need us for many things. We are only boys, we have
not wives that we refuse to give to the white men&ndash;&ndash;if
we had it might be different, who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the cause?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white men will give a different one&ndash;&ndash;but
that is the cause! The men of this valley think it is
enough if they give their houses, and their corn, and
their woven blankets to their fine white brothers:&ndash;&ndash;the
red men are foolish men,&ndash;&ndash;so they burn at the
stake out there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ka-yemo stared at him, and crouched in his blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say strange things,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I think
when they get crazy with the spirit to kill that they
will kill us all. I do not stay to be killed&ndash;&ndash;I go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; staring at the emblems of holiness on the
altar scarcely heard him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go, Tahn-t&eacute;,&ndash;&ndash;I go if I have to swim the river
with the ice.&ndash;&ndash;Do you stay here to be killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here to learn many things&ndash;&ndash;I learn but
little yet, I cannot go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;if you die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is not yet that I die,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;There
is much to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;if I live to see&ndash;&ndash;our people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell my mother I am strong&ndash;&ndash;and I feel her
prayers when the sun comes up. Tell the governor
I stay to learn what the white god does for the red
men; when I have things to tell the people I will come
back to Povi-whah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the ice of that winter melted, and the summer
bore its fruit, and the second spring time had come to
the land before Tahn-t&eacute; crossed the mesas and stood
at his mother&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks&ndash;&ndash;that you have come,&rdquo; she said, and
wept, and he held her hand and did not know the
things to say, only:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Thanks that our gods have
brought me back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the magic of the white man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; and he opened a bag made of buffalo
skin, and in it were books and papers covered with
written words. She looked on them with awe. Her
son was only a boy but he had won that which was
precious, and earned honors from the men of her tribe
and her clan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to me must you tell it first,&rdquo; she said&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;The
Ruler will hear you, and the governor,&ndash;&ndash;they will
decide if it is to be known, or if it is to be secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old men sprinkled prayer meal&ndash;&ndash;and smoked
medicine smoke over the books to lift any lingering
curses from the white men&rsquo;s god, and then the boy
opened the pages and made clear how the marks stood
for words, and the words put all together stood for
the talk of the white god. It was a thing of wonder
to the council.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is a strong god?&rdquo; asked the Ruler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is strong for war:&ndash;&ndash;not for peace,&rdquo; said the
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ka-yemo brought back the words of the medicine-man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
of the grey blanket who talked of their god.
All his talk was of peace and of love in the heart.
Is that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true. He was a good man. It may be that
some men are born so good that even the gods of the
men of iron cannot make them evil. And Padre
Luis was born into the world like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We listen to you to hear of the moons and the
suns since you went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy told of the fruitless search to the east for
the wonderful land of the slave&rsquo;s romance, where the
natives used golden bowls instead of earthen vessels
for food, where each soldier was so sure of gaining
riches that the weight of provisions carried was small
lest the animals be not strong enough to carry all the
gold and the food also.</p>
<p>The old men laughed much at this search for the
symbol of the Sun Father along the waters of the
Mischipi, and commended the wise men of Ci-cu-y&eacute;
who had the foresight to plan the romance, and to
send the slave to lead the adventurers to the land of
false dreams.</p>
<p>It was bad, however, that the strangers had not lost
themselves in the prairies, or were not killed by the
fierce tribes of the north:&ndash;&ndash;it was bad that they
came back to the villages of the P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute; river.</p>
<p>Then the boy told of the final despair of the conquerors,
and their disheartened retreat to the land of
the south. For two years they had terrorized the
people of the land&ndash;&ndash;worse enemies than the Navahu
or the Comanche or the Apache fighter, then when
they had made ruins where towns and gardens had
been, they said it was all of no use since the yellow
metal was not found in the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the wise men of iron not know that where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
the yellow metal is in the earth, that there is ever the
symbol of the Sun Father, and that it must be a thing
sacred and a hidden place for prayer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did not know that:&ndash;&ndash;no man told them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>K[=a]-ye-fah, the ancient Ruler blew smoke from his
pipe to the four ways, and spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet among the men they burned to ashes in the
village square were many who could have told them
that, and three who could have told them where such
prayer places were hidden! It is well, my children,
that they did die, and not tell that which the Sun
Father has hidden for his own people:&ndash;&ndash;it is
well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well!&rdquo; echoed the others of the council.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all die when the day or the night comes,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;continued
the old man. &ldquo;It is well that we die in
bravery for the sake of the others who have to live
and walk the earth path. It is well that we have
strong hearts to think about. One day I shall go in
the ground with my fathers; I am old, and the trail
has been long, and in my old days the sunlight has
been covered for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; did not know what he meant, but the other
men bent their heads in sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is twice four moons since my child K[=a]-ye-povi
was carried away in the darkness when we fought the
Navahu in the hunting grounds to the west,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he
continued. &ldquo;No one has found her&ndash;&ndash;no trader
has brought her back. When a woman, she will not
know her own people, or our own speech. I think
of that, and grow weak. Our people have never
been slaves&ndash;&ndash;yet she will be a slave for our enemy
the Navahu! So it is that I grow old more quick,
and the time may come soon to sleep on our Mother&ndash;&ndash;the
Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We wish that it comes not soon,&rdquo; said the governor,
and the others signified their assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, thanks that you wish it. I do not speak
of it to give sad hearts. I speak because of the days
when I may be gone, and another than me will hold
the knowledge of a sacred place where the Sun Father
hides his symbol. It is good that I hear of the men
who let themselves go into ashes, and when if they
had said once:&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;I know where it is&ndash;&ndash;the metal
of the Sun!&rsquo; all might have gone free and lived long
days. My children:&ndash;&ndash;it may be that some day one
of you will hold a secret of the sacred place where
strong magic lives! If it be so, let that man among
you think in his heart of the twenty times ten men
who let themselves be burned into ashes by the white
men of iron! Guard you the sacred places&ndash;&ndash;and
let your ashes go into the sands, or be blown by the
winds to the four ways. But from the sacred things
of the gods, lift not the cover for the enemy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man trembled with the intensity of the
thought and the dread of what the unborn years
might bring.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence the governor spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be that you live the longest of all! No
one knows who will guard the things not to be told.
But no Te-hua can uncover that which belongs to the
Sun Father, and the Earth Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true:&ndash;&ndash;thanks that it is true!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;said the
other men, and Tahn-t&eacute; knew he was listening to
things not told to boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks that you speak so,&rdquo; said the Ruler.
&ldquo;Now we have all spoken of this matter. It is
done. But the magic of the white hunters of gold,
we have not yet heard spoken. How is it, boy, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
you have brought all these signs of it:&ndash;&ndash;what made
blind their eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not anything,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;. &ldquo;It was a long
time I was with them. Some men had one book, or
two, other men had papers that came in great canoes
from their land in Spain. Some had writings from
their fathers or their friends. These I heard read
and talked of around the camp fire. When they
went away some things were thrown aside or given
to the padres who were to stay and talk of their gods.
All I found I hid in the earth. The people of Ci-bo-la
killed Padre Juan, and I traded a broken sword
for his books and his papers. The sword I also had
buried. They were afraid of the books, I had
learned to read them, and I was not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you came from Ci-bo-la alone?&rdquo; asked the
governor,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;it is a long trail to carry a load.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All was not carried from there. I came back to
Ci-cu-y&eacute; to learn more from Padre Luis who meant
to live there. He did not live so long, but while he
lived he taught me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men of Ci-cu-y&eacute; killed him too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They made him die when they said I must not
take beans or meal to him where he lived in a cave,
and where he made prayers for their shadow spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wanted that he should have food?&rdquo; asked
the Ruler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted that he should live to teach me all the
books before the end came,&rdquo; said the boy simply.
&ldquo;It is not all to be learned in two winters and one
summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said K[=a]-ya-fah the Ruler. &ldquo;All
of a man&rsquo;s life is needed to learn certain things of
magic. It is time now that you come back and begin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
the work of the Orders. You have earned the highest
right a boy has yet earned, and no doors will be
closed for you on the sacred things given to people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think that is so,&rdquo; said the governor&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;no
doors will be closed for the son of S[=aa]-hanh-que-ah,
the Woman of the Twilight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the hour he had dreamed of through the
months which had seemed horrible as the white man&rsquo;s
hell. One needs only to read the several accounts
of Coronado&rsquo;s quest for the golden land of the Gran
Quivera in 1540-42 to picture what the life of a
little native page must have been with the dissatisfied
adventurers, by whom all &ldquo;Indians&rdquo; were considered
as slaves should their service be required.</p>
<p>Men had died beside him on the trail&ndash;&ndash;and there
had been times when he felt he too would die but for
the thought of this hour when he could come back,
and the council could say&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;It is well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, and my mother will thank you,&rdquo;
he said with his eyes on the stones of the kiva lest
the men see that his eyes were wet. &ldquo;My mother
said prayers with me always, and that helped me to
come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prayers of the Shadow Woman are high
medicine,&rdquo; assented one of the men. &ldquo;She brought
back my son to live when the breath was gone away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a little child she had a wisdom not to be
taught,&rdquo; affirmed the Ruler&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and now it is her son
who brings us the magic of the iron men. Tell us
how you left the people of Ci-cu-y&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were having glad dances that the Christians
were gone, and that the padres were dead as other
men die. So long as they let me I carried food and
water to Padre Luis. Then they guarded me in the
kiva, and laughed at me, and when they let me go I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
knew it was because he was no longer alive. No:&ndash;&ndash;they
did not harm me. They were too pleased
that I could tell them of where their slave whom
they called the &lsquo;Turk&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;led the gold hunters
searching for the Quivera of yellow metal and blue
stones. They had much delight to hear of the woeful
time of the white men. I could stay all my days at
Ci-cu-y&eacute; and be precious to them, if I would talk of
the trouble trail to Quivera, but when I had seen that
the Padre was indeed gone to the Lost Others, my
work was no more at Ci-cu-y&eacute;. I took his books also
for my own&ndash;&ndash;and all these things I have brought
back at Povi-whah to make good my promise when
I went away. Some things in the books, I know,
and that I can tell you. Of the rest I will work
until I do know, and then I can tell you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; said K[=a]-ye-fah the Ruler. &ldquo;You
shall be as my son and in the long nights of the winter
moons we will listen. The time told of in the
prophecies of Ki-pah is coming to us. He said also
that in each danger time would be born one to mark
the way for the people to follow&ndash;&ndash;in each danger
time so long as the Te-hua people were true to the
gods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; breathed on the hand of the old men, and
went up from the kiva into the cool night of the early
summer.</p>
<p>It was too wonderful a night for aught but to reach
up in thought to the height of the warm stars. They
came so close he could feel their radiance in his heart.</p>
<p>Twice had his name in council been linked to the
prophecies of the wise and mysterious prophet of the
ancient days! Always he had known that the
Woman of the Twilight and he were not to live the
life of the others. He had not known why they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
were set apart for unusual experiences, but to-night
he dared to think. With the words of the wise men
still in his ears&ndash;&ndash;the rulers who could make and unmake&ndash;&ndash;he
knew that no other boy had ever heard
the praise and promise he had heard. He knew they
thought they were giving words to one who would be
a leader in the years to come&ndash;&ndash;and this first night
under the peace of the stars, he was filled with a triumph
and an exaltation for which there were no
words.</p>
<p>He would be a leader&ndash;&ndash;not of war&ndash;&ndash;not of
government for the daily duties of village life, but
of the Things of the Spirit which seemed calling
within him to highest endeavor. He knew as yet
nothing of Te-hua ceremonies&ndash;&ndash;he had all to learn,
yet he felt inspired to invent some expression for the
joy which was his.</p>
<p>The new moon seemed to rest on the very edge of
the mesa above him:&ndash;&ndash;the uplifted horn looked like
a white flame rising from purple shadows.</p>
<p>A white flame!&ndash;&ndash;a <i>white</i> flame!</p>
<p>To the Indian mind all signs are symbolic,&ndash;&ndash;and
the flame was exactly above the point where the light
was set ceremonially and regularly to light the Indian
god back to his own people!</p>
<p>A point of white flame above that shrine of
centuries!</p>
<p>No eyes but his saw it at exactly that angle&ndash;&ndash;of
course it was not meant for other eyes. It was meant
that it should be seen by him alone on his first night
with the people he meant to work for! With the
memory of the prophecies in his ears had he seen it.
It could mean only that the god himself set it there
as a proof that the devotion of Tahn-t&eacute; was acceptable&ndash;&ndash;and
that he had been born of his mother that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
prophecies might be fulfilled at the right time&ndash;&ndash;and
that the light of the moon on his face had meant&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>His thought came so quickly that all the air of the
night appeared alive with the unseen&ndash;&ndash;and the unseen
murmured in his ears, and his memories&ndash;&ndash;and
in his heart!</p>
<p>Suddenly he stretched his open hands high to the
stars, and then ran across the level to the foot of the
bluff. It was high and very steep, but wings seemed
his&ndash;&ndash;his heart was on the summit, and his body
must follow&ndash;&ndash;must get there before the white flame
sank into the west&ndash;&ndash;must send his greeting to answer
the greeting of the god!</p>
<p>In the pouch at his girdle was the fire flint, and
a wisp of the silky wild flax of tinder. Two sticks
of dead scrub pi&ntilde;on was there; he broke them in equal
lengths and laid them in the cross which is the symbol
of the four ways, and of the four winds from which
the sacred breath is drawn for all that lives&ndash;&ndash;the
symbol also of union by which all human life is
perpetuated. All fires of sacrifices,&ndash;&ndash;or of magic
power, must commemorate these things which are
sacred things, and Tahn-t&eacute; placed them and breathed
upon them, and touched them with the spark from
the white flint, and then arose in joy and faced the
moon yet visible, knowing that the god had seen his
answering flame on the shrine&ndash;&ndash;and that it meant
a dedication to the Things of the Spirit.</p>
<p>And as he stood there on the mesa&rsquo;s edge, exalted
at the wonder of the night, he did not speak, yet he
heard the echo of words in his own voice:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;<i>No
one but Tahn-t&eacute; shall gather the woods for the fire to
light Po-se-yemo back;&ndash;&ndash;and when he sees the blaze,
and comes back, you will tell him it was his son who
kept the fire!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>Like a flash came the memory of that other time
at the edge of that other mesa in Hopi-land! He
had said those words to his mother&ndash;&ndash;and had forgotten
them. He could never forget them again,
for the god had sent them back to him to remember.
And Tahn-t&eacute; trembled at the wondrous signs given
him this night, and sprinkled meal to the four ways,
and held prayer thoughts of exaltation in his heart.</p>
<p>And this was the last day of the boy years of
Tahn-t&eacute;.</p>
<p>He began then the years of the work for which his
Other Self told him he had been born on earth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>TAHN-T&Eacute;&ndash;&ndash;THE RULER</h3>
</div>
<p>Summers of the Sun, and winters when the
stars danced for the snow, had passed over
the valley of Povi-whah. New people had
been born into the world, and old people had died,
but the oldest man in the council, K[=a]-ye-fah&ndash;&ndash;the
Ruler of Things from the Beginning, had lived many
years after the time when he thought the shadow life
must come to him. And to the Woman of the
Twilight he had said that it was her son who kept
him living&ndash;&ndash;her son to whom he taught the ancient
things of his own youth. In the keen enthusiasms he
had found such a son as he had longed for. The
lost daughter, K[=a]-ye-povi, he had never found&ndash;&ndash;and
never forgotten. To Tahn-t&eacute; he had talked of her
until she almost lived in their lives. The face of the
god-maid on the south mesa had for K[=a]-ye-fah the
outline of chin and backward sweep of hair strangely
akin to the face of the lost child. He liked to think
the god-maid belonged more to his clan of Towa
Toan&ndash;&ndash;the High Mesa clan&ndash;&ndash;than to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she had not gone into the shadow land, her
face would have looked that way,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we could gather bright flowers for her hair,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;said
the boy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;they would be sweeter than the
cold, far brightness of the stars where the god-maid
waits,&rdquo; and he pointed to where Antares gleamed
from the heart of the Scorpion above the dusk profile,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I
think of K[=a]-ye-povi as the dream maid. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
will be my always young sweetheart&ndash;&ndash;my only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; said K[=a]-ye-fah&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;very good for
the work of the unborn years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the youth was to carry on the tribal prayers
to the gods when K[=a]-ye-fah no longer walked on
earth. And his teaching must be greater than all
other teaching, for the Ruler was planning for the
work of the days to come.</p>
<p>And in a day of the early spring the work was
made ready, for to S[=aa]-hanh-que-ah he said:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;A
week ago So-hoah-tza went under the waters of the
river and never breathed again. To him was given
the guard of the sacred place of the Sun Father. I
have not yet made any other the guardian. You are
the woman of the order of the Po-Ahtun&ndash;&ndash;I give
you the guard to keep. Call the governor&ndash;&ndash;but
call your son first. You shall be guard as So-hoah-tza
was guard, but Tahn-t&eacute; shall be guard as I have
been! Lean lower, and let your ear listen and your
heart keep sacred the word. I go to our Lost Others&ndash;&ndash;but
I leave you to guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The governor came, and all were sad, but no one
thought that the life was over. K[=a]-ye-fah talked and
smiled as one who goes to a feast.</p>
<p>But Tahn-t&eacute;, standing tall and still by the couch
said:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;It will be over! This morning he wakened
and said he would go with the sun to-day. He has
no other thought, and he will go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the women wept, and made ready the things
of burial for the high priest of the highest order. If
Tahn-t&eacute; said he would go into the shadows at that
time&ndash;&ndash;the women knew that it would be so. Tahn-t&eacute;,
as they knew him, joyous in the dances of the
seasons,&ndash;&ndash;was never in their minds apart from
Tahn-t&eacute; the prophet whose dreams even as a boy, had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
been beyond the dreams of the others who sought
visions.</p>
<p>And as the sun touched the black line of the pines
on the western mountain, the aged Ruler asked for his
wand of office, and the governor gave it to him, and
with his own hand he gave it to Tahn-t&eacute;, that even
when his own form was covered with the soil, his
vote would be on record in the minds of those who
listened&ndash;&ndash;and that vote gave to his pupil in magic,
the wand of power&ndash;&ndash;The youngest qualified
member of the Order of Spiritual things was thus
acclaimed as the Po-Ahtun-ho, a Ruler of Things
from the Beginning.</p>
<p>Twenty-four years he had lived&ndash;&ndash;but the time
of life with the white men had counted more than
double. In magic of many kinds he was more wise
than the men of years, and the heart of his mother
was glad with the almost perfect gladness when
Tahn-t&eacute; stood in the place of the Ancient Wisdom
and listened as the ear of the god listens to the recitation
of many tribal prayers.</p>
<p>The Po-Ahtun-ho also listens at times to the individual
appeals of the things of every day life&ndash;&ndash;as a
father listens to a child who seeks advice. To the
more ancient Rulers the younger people were often
afraid to go&ndash;&ndash;various &ldquo;uncles&rdquo; of the village were
appealed to instead. But the youth of Tahn-t&eacute; made
all things different&ndash;&ndash;even the love of a man for a
maid, was not so small a thing that the new Ruler
made the suppliant feel how little it was.</p>
<p>And one of the first who came to him thus&ndash;&ndash;who
knelt and offered a prayer to him, the prayer of a
love, was the little Apache tigress who had been first
of his own village to greet him in Ua-lano&ndash;&ndash;Yahn
Tsyn-deh, who had grown so pretty that the men of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
the other villages talked of her, and her mother had
asked great gifts for her. But the mother had died
with the winter, and Yahn refused to be subject to the
Tain-tsain clan of her father, and there had been much
trouble until she threatened to go back to her mother&rsquo;s
tribe, and many thought it might come to that after
all&ndash;&ndash;for she was very strong of will.</p>
<p>But before Tahn-t&eacute; the Po-Ahtun-ho she crouched,
and sobs shook her, and her hair covered her face as
a veil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is of the clan, Yahn, it is to the governor you
should speak:&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;from him it may
come to me if he thinks best. There are rules we
must not break. Because I carried you, when little,
on my shoulder, is no reason to walk past the door
of the governor and bring his duties to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke kindly, for his heart was kind towards
the little fighter of boyhood&rsquo;s days. Her alien blood
was ever prompting her to reckless daring beyond
the customs of Te-hua maidens. In a different way,
he himself was an alien and it helped him to understand
her. But this day he saw another Yahn&ndash;&ndash;one
he had not known could hide under the reckless exterior.</p>
<p>She tossed back her hair and faced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I speak with Phen-tza the governor&ndash;&ndash;he
is the uncle of Ka-yemo! It is he who has
helped do this thing&ndash;&ndash;he would make me a slave or
have me whipped! How should I speak with him?
Ka-yemo knows that the governor his uncle, will&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ka-yemo! What has Ka-yemo done? What
trouble does he make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;&ndash;no trouble!&rdquo; her words were bitter words,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Only
the governor his uncle, has talked with the
family of Tsa-fah and the marriage is made with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
daughter Koh-p&eacute; of the beads, and you&ndash;&ndash;know,
Tahn-t&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; did know, he regarded her in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she pleaded. &ldquo;You are more than
governor&ndash;&ndash;you are the Highest! Magic is yours
to make and to unmake. Unmake this thing! With
your magic send him back to me&ndash;&ndash;to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magic is not for that:&ndash;&ndash;it is for Those
Above!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she flung herself at his feet and wept. The
sobs hurt him, yet he must not lift her. She begged
for a charm&ndash;&ndash;for a spell&ndash;&ndash;for black magic to
strike dead the wearer of the red bears and the blue
beads, for all wild things a wild passion could suggest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could see into the other years you would
be content to have it as it is,&rdquo; he said gently&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the
years ahead may&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care nothing for the years ahead! I want the
<i>now</i>!&ndash;&ndash;I want&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he said, and she fell silent with covered
face. &ldquo;That which you feel for Ka-yemo is not the
love of marriage. A man takes a wife for love of a
wife and a home and children in the home. A man
does not chain himself to a tigress whose bite and
whose blows he has felt. A man would wish to be
master:&ndash;&ndash;what man has been born who could be
master in your home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know. You have lived a different
sort of life! I could be more than another wife&ndash;&ndash;than
any other wife! I shall kill some one!&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; and
she rose to her feet&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;unless the magic comes I kill
some one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Phen-tza the governor will have me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
strangled, and they will take me to my grave with
ropes of raw hide and there will not any where be
a sad heart for Yahn Tsyn-deh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see how it is&ndash;&ndash;he is precious to you&ndash;&ndash;as he
always has been. But your love is too great a love for
happy days. Always it will bring you the ache in
the heart. No thing of earth should be given the
love like that:&ndash;&ndash;it is a fire to burn a whole forest
in the days of its summer, and in the winter snows
there will be only ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&ndash;&ndash;then I, Yahn, will rather burn to the
ashes in such summer days, and be dead under the
snows in the winter of the year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that will not the Po-Ahtun-ho be Ruler
always? Will he not remember his friends who are
precious in the Beyond as he remembers this one to-day?&rdquo;
she asked mockingly. &ldquo;K[=a]-ye-fah told the
council that you have lived a life no other man lives,
and that no woman is precious to you:&ndash;&ndash;when you
find the woman who is yet to come, may a viper poison
her blood&ndash;&ndash;may a cat of the hills tear her flesh!
May you love until madness comes&ndash;&ndash;and may the
woman find only death in your arms&ndash;&ndash;and find it
quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Woman of the Twilight came in from
the field with yellow corn pollen for the sacred ceremonies,
the lattice of reeds at the outer door was yet
shaking as from touch of a ruthless hand, or a strong
wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it that cried here?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Who
has left you sad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps a prophetess, my mother,&rdquo; answered
Tahn-t&eacute;, and sat thoughtful where Yahn had left
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
him. And after a long time he arose and sought
the governor.</p>
<p>But it was fated that the governor and the new
Ruler were not to talk of the love of a maid or the
marriage of a man that day.</p>
<p>A runner had been sent to Povi-whah from Kat-yi-ti.
He gave his message, and stayed to eat while
other runners took the trail, and before the sun had
moved the width of a hand across the sky, the villages
of Kah-po and Tsa-mah and Oj-ke were starting other
runners to Ui-la-ua and far Te-gat-ha and at Kah-po
the head men gathered to talk in great council over
the word brought from the south.</p>
<p>For the word was that the men of the iron and
the beards and the white skins were again coming to
the land of the People of the Sun. They came in
peace, and searched for the lost padres. A man of
the gown was with them for prayers, and a Te-hua
man who had been caught by the Navahu long winters
ago and traded to the land of green birds. The
Te-hua man said the white people were good people,
and he was guiding them to the villages by the big
river, P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute;.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE SILKEN SCARF</h3>
</div>
<p>Of the many godly enterprises set afoot for
exploration and conquest in New Spain of
the sixteenth century, not all have chronicles
important enough for the historian to make much of.
But there were goings and comings of which no
written record reached the archives. Things forbidden
did happen even under the iron heel of Castilian
rule, and one of the hidden enterprises grew to
be a part of the life of the P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute; valley for a
time.</p>
<p>Not that it was unchronicled, but there was a good
reason why the records were not published for the
Spanish court.</p>
<p>It was a pretty romantic reason also&ndash;&ndash;and the
usual one, if we may trust the world&rsquo;s judgment of
the foundation of all trouble. But a maid tossing
a blossom from a Mexic balcony could not know that
the stranger from Seville to whom it was thrown was
the son of an Eminence, instead of the simple gentleman
named Don Ruy Sandoval in a royal letter to
the Viceroy. With him travelled his tutor whose
tutelage was past, and the position a difficult one for
even the Viceroy to comprehend.</p>
<p>Since the youth rebelled at the habit of a monk&ndash;&ndash;he
had been given a space for adventure under godly
surveillance. The godly surveillance limped a trifle
at times. And because of this did Don Ruy walk
again in the moonlight under the balcony and this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
time more than a blossom came to him&ndash;&ndash;about the
stem of a scarlet lily was a flutter of white! The
warm light of the Mexic moon helped him to decipher
it&ndash;&ndash;a page from Ariosto&ndash;&ndash;the romance of Do&ntilde;a
Bradamante&ndash;&ndash;and the mark of a pen under words
uttered by the warrior-maid herself&ndash;&ndash;words to warm
a cooler youth than this one from over seas:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;<i>Why
seek I one who flies from me?&ndash;&ndash;Why implore one
who deigns not to send me reply?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon there was no further delay as to reply&ndash;&ndash;there
was found an open gate to a garden where
only stars gave light, where little hands were held for
a moment in his&ndash;&ndash;soft whispers had answered his
own&ndash;&ndash;and he was held in thrall by a lace wrapped
se&ntilde;orita whose face he had not even looked on in the
light. All of Castile could give one no better start
in a week than he had found for himself in three days
in the new world of promise.</p>
<p>For there were promises&ndash;&ndash;and they were sweet.
They had to do with a tryst two nights away&ndash;&ndash;then
the lady, whom he called &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Bradamante&rdquo; because
of the page torn from that romance, would enlighten
him as to her pressing need of the aid of a
gentleman, and courage would be hers to tell him
why a marked line and a scarlet lily had been let fall
in his path&ndash;&ndash;and why she had trusted his face at
first sight&ndash;&ndash;though he had not yet seen her own&ndash;&ndash;and
why&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>It was the usual thing&ndash;&ndash;the page of a poem and
a silken scarf as a guerdon of her trust.</p>
<p>He found the place of the tryst with ease for a
stranger in the Mexic streets, but a glimmer of white
robe was all he saw of his unknown &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Bradamante.&rdquo;
Others were at the tryst, and their staves
and arms lacked no strength. He heard a woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
scream, then he heard her try again to scream and
fail because of a hand on her throat, and beyond that
he knew little for a night or two, and there was not
much of day between.</p>
<p>Monkly robes were the next thing in his range of
vision&ndash;&ndash;one face in particular, sallow and still with
eyes glancing sideways, seeing all things;&ndash;&ndash;divining
much! soft steps, and bandages, and out of silence
the excited shrillness of Don Diego Maria Francisco
Brancadori the tutor:&ndash;&ndash;the shepherd who had lost
track of his one rather ruffled lamb.</p>
<p>Pious ejaculation&ndash;&ndash;thanks to all the saints he
could think of&ndash;&ndash;horror that the son of an Eminence
should be thus abused&ndash;&ndash;prophecies of the wrath to
come when the duchess, his mother&ndash;&ndash;At this Don
Ruy groped for a sword, and found a boot, and flung
it, with an unsanctified word or two, in the direction
of the lamentation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wail worse than a dog of a Lutheran under
the yoke,&rdquo; he said in as good a voice as he could
muster with a cut in his lip. &ldquo;What matter how
much Eminence it took to make a father for me&ndash;&ndash;or
how many duchesses to make a mother? I am
labelled as plain Ruy Sandoval and shipped till called
for. If you are to instruct my youth in the path it
should tread&ndash;&ndash;why not start in with a lesson on
discretion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this hopeful sign of life from the bundle of
bandages on the monk&rsquo;s bed, Maestro Diego approached
and looked over his illustrious charge
with a careful eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Discretion has limped far behind&ndash;&ndash;enterprise,
else your highness would cut a different figure by
now&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Choke back your infernal highnesses!&rdquo; growled
the younger man. &ldquo;I know well what your task is
to be here in this new land:&ndash;&ndash;it is to send back reports
of duty each time I break a rule or get a broken
head. Now by the Blood, and the Cross, if you
smother not your titles, and let me range free, I tell
you the thing I will do:&ndash;&ndash;I will send back a complaint
against you to Seville&ndash;&ndash;and to make sure that
it goes, no hand shall carry it but your own. Ere
they can find another nurse maid for my morals,
I&rsquo;ll build me a ship and go sailing the South seas for
adventure&ndash;&ndash;and your court tricksters will have a
weary time in the chase! I like you better than many
another godly spy who might have been sent, and
I promise myself much joy in the journal of strange
travels it is in your mind to write. But once for all,
remember, we never were born into the world until
a week ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your Excellency&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Great Duke of Hell! Will you not
bridle your tongue when the damned monks are three
deep at the key hole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By which it will be seen that the travels of the pious
Don Diego were not all on paths of roses.</p>
<p>A little later the still faced priest of the stealthy
glances came in, and Don Ruy sat on the side of the
bed, and looked him over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the one who picked me up&ndash;&ndash;eh? And
the gentlemen of the streets had tossed me into a
corner after discreetly starting my soul on its travels!
Warm trysts your dames give to a stranger in this
land&ndash;&ndash;when you next confess the darlings, whisper
their ears to be less bloodthirsty towards youth
innocence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the robe smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That unwise maid will make no more trysts,&rdquo; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
said quietly,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;not if she be one important enough
to cause an assault on your Highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;harm would not be done to her,
but her destiny is without doubt a convent. The
men who spoiled your tryst earn no purses as guard
for girls of the street,&ndash;&ndash;sacred walls will save them
that trouble for a time&ndash;&ndash;whether maid or wife I
dare promise you that! It is as well you know.
Time is wasted seeking adventure placed beyond
mortal reach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Convent&ndash;&ndash;eh? Do your holy retreats teach
the little tricks the lady knew? And do they furnish
their vestals with poems of romance and silks and
spices of Kathay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew from an inner pocket a little scarf of apple
green with knotted fringes, and butterflies, various
colored in dainty broidery. As the folds fell apart an
odor of sweetness stole into the shadowy room of
the monastery, and the priest was surprised into an
ejaculation at sight of such costly evidence, but he
smothered it hastily in a muttered prayer.</p>
<p>After that he listened to few of the stranger&rsquo;s gibes
and quips, but with a book of prayers on his knee
he looked the youth over carefully, recalled the outburst
of Don Diego as to origin, and the adventurer&rsquo;s
own threat to build a ship and sail where chance
pointed. Plainly, this seeker of trysts, or any other
thing promising adventure, had more of resource than
one might expect from a battered stranger lifted out
of the gutter for the last rites.</p>
<p>The priest&ndash;&ndash;who looked a good soldier and who
was called Padre Vicente &ldquo;de los Chichimecos&rdquo; (of
the wild tribes) read further in his book of hours,
and then spoke the thing in his mind.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;For a matter of many years in this land of the
Indies I have waited for a man of discreet determination
for a certain work. The virgin herself led me
to the gutter where you groaned in the dark, and I
here vow to build her a chapel if this thought of mine
bears fruit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hump! My thanks to our Lady,&ndash;&ndash;and I myself
will see to the building of the chapel. But tell
me of the tree you would plant, and we&rsquo;ll then have
a guess at the fruit. It may prove sour to the taste!
Monkly messes appealed to me little on the other
side of the seas. I&rsquo;ve yet to test their flavor on this
shore of adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Padre Vicente ignored the none too respectful comment&ndash;&ndash;and
took from his pocket a bit of virgin gold
strung on a thread of deer sinew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name is Don Ruy Sandoval,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You are in this land for adventure. You content
yourself with the latticed window and the strife of
the streets&ndash;&ndash;why not look for the greater things?
You have wealth and power at your call&ndash;&ndash;why not
search for an empire of&ndash;&ndash;this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he showed the virgin gold worn smooth by
much wearing.</p>
<p>Don Ruy blinked under the bandage and swore by
Bradamante of the adventure that he would search
for it gladly if but the way was shown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do we find this golden mistress of
yours?&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;and why have you waited
long for a comrade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gold is in the north where none dare openly
seek treasure, or even souls, since Coronado came
back broken and disgraced. I have waited for the
man of wealth who dared risk it, and&ndash;&ndash;at whose
going the Viceroy could wink.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why wink at me&ndash;&ndash;rather than another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a secret knotted in the fringes of the
silken scarf there&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; said Padre Vicente with a grim
smile. &ldquo;Cannot a way be found to clear either a
convent or a palace of a trouble breeder, when the
church itself lends a hand? You were plainly a
breeder of trouble, else had you escaped the present
need of bandages. For the first time I see a way
where Church and the government of the Indies can
go with clasped hands to this work. In gold and
converts the work may prove mighty. How mighty
depends whether you come to the Indies to kill time
until the day you are recalled&ndash;&ndash;or improve that
time by success where Coronado failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we echo his failure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None will be the wiser even then! You plan
for a season of hunting in the hills. I plan for a
mission visit by the Sea of Cortez. Mine will be the
task to see how and where our helpers join each other
and all the provisioning of man and beast. Mine also
to make it clear to the Viceroy that you repent your&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hollo!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Don Ruy interrupted with a grimace.
&ldquo;You are about to say I repent of folly&ndash;&ndash;or the
enticing of a virgin&ndash;&ndash;or that I fell victim to the
blandishments of some tricky dame&ndash;&ndash;I know all
that cant by rote!&ndash;&ndash;a man always repents until his
broken head is mended, but all that is apart from the
real thing&ndash;&ndash;which is this:&ndash;&ndash;In what way does my
moment with a lady in the dark affect the Viceroy
of the Indies? Why should his Excellency trouble
himself that Ruy Sandoval has a broken head&ndash;&ndash;and
a silken scarf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Padre Vicente stared&ndash;&ndash;then smiled. Ruy Sandoval
had not his wits smothered by the cotton wool
of exalted pamperings.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I will be frank with you,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;The
Viceroy I have not yet addressed on this matter. But
such silken scarfs are few&ndash;&ndash;that one would not be
a heavy task to trace to its owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&ndash;&ndash;I suspected your eminence had been a
gallant in your time,&rdquo; remarked Don Ruy, amicably&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;It
is not easy to get out of the habit of noticing
alluring things:&ndash;&ndash;that is why I refused to do
penance for my birth by turning monk, and shrouding
myself in the gown! Now come&ndash;&ndash;tell me!
You seem a good fellow&ndash;&ndash;tell me of the &lsquo;Do&ntilde;a
Bradamante&rsquo; of the silks and the spices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The destiny of that person is probably already
decided,&rdquo; stated the priest of the wild tribes, &ldquo;she is,
if I mistake not, too close to the charge of the
Viceroy himself for that destiny to be questioned.
The mother, it is said, died insane, and the time
has come when the daughter also is watched with all
care lest she harm herself&ndash;&ndash;or her attendants. So
I hear&ndash;&ndash;the maid I do not know, but the scarf I
can trace. Briefly&ndash;&ndash;the evident place for such a
wanton spitfire is the convent. You can easily see
the turmoil a woman like that can make as each ship
brings adventurers&ndash;&ndash;and she seeks a lover out of
every group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus!&ndash;&ndash;and hell to come! Then I was only
one of a sort&ndash;&ndash;all is fish to the net of the love lorn
lady! Maestro Diego would have had the romance
and the lily if he had walked ahead instead of behind
me!&ndash;&ndash;and he could have had the broken head
as well!&rdquo; Then he sniffed again at the bit of silk,
and regarded the monk quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a good story, and you tell it well, holy
father,&rdquo; he said at last,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and I am troubled in my
mind to know how little of it may be truth, and how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
much a godly lie. But the gold at least is true gold,
and whatever the trick of the lady may be, you say
it will serve to win for me the privilege to seek the
mines without blare of trumpets. Hum!&ndash;&ndash;it is a
great favor for an unknown adventurer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unknown you may be to the people of the streets,
and to your ship mates,&rdquo; agreed the Padre. &ldquo;But
be sure the Viceroy has more than a hint that you are
not of the rabble. The broils you may draw to yourself
may serve to disquiet him much&ndash;&ndash;yet he would
scarce send you to the stocks, or the service of the
roads. Be sure he would rather than all else bid
you god speed on a hunting journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that you are so given to frankness I should
look also for a knife in the back to be included in
his excellency&rsquo;s favors,&rdquo; commented Don Ruy.
&ldquo;Name of the Devil!&ndash;&ndash;what have I done since I
entered the town, but hold hands with one woman in
the dark&ndash;&ndash;and be made to look as if I had been laid
across a butcher block on a busy day! Hell take
such a city to itself! I&rsquo;ve no fancy for halting over
long in a pit where a gentleman&rsquo;s amusements are so
little understood. If the Do&ntilde;a of the scarf were
aught but an amiable maniac the thing would be
different. I would stay&ndash;&ndash;and I would find her and
together we would weave a new romance for a new
world poet! But as it is, gather your cut throats
and name the day, and we&rsquo;ll go scouring the land for
heathen souls and yellow clinkers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Padre Vicente de Bernaldez was known by his
wonderful mission-work to be an ecclesiastic of most
adventurous disposition. Into wild lands and beyond
the Sea of Cortez had he gone alone to the wild tribes&ndash;&ndash;so
far had he gone that silence closed over his trail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
like a grave at times&ndash;&ndash;but out of the Unknown had
he come in safety!</p>
<p>His fame had reached beyond his order&ndash;&ndash;and
Ruy Sandoval knew that it was no common man who
spoke to him of the Indian gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Francisco de Coronado,&rdquo; stated this padre of the
wilderness, &ldquo;came back empty handed from the north
land of the civilized Indians for the reason that he
knew not where to search. The gold is there. This
is witness. It came to me from a man who&ndash;&ndash;is
dead! It was given him by a woman of a certain
tribe of sun worshippers. To her it was merely
some symbol of their pagan faith&ndash;&ndash;some priestly
circle dedicated to the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds well,&rdquo; agreed Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but the
trail? Who makes the way? And what force is
needed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a guide the Padre Vicente had a slave of that
land, a man of Te-hua baptized Jos&eacute;, for five years
the padre had studied the words and the plans. The
man would gladly go to his own land,&ndash;&ndash;he and his
wife. All that was required was a general with
wealth for the conquest. There were pagan souls
to be saved, and there was wealth for the more
worldly minds. The padre asked only a tenth for
godly reasons.</p>
<p>Thus between church and state was the expedition
of his Excellency Don Ruy Sandoval ignored except
as a hunting journey to the North coast of the Cortez
Sea&ndash;&ndash;if he ranged farther afield, his own be the
peril, for no troops of state were sent as companions.
The good father had selected the men&ndash;&ndash;most of
them he had confessed at odd times and knew their
metal. All engaged as under special duty to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
cross:&ndash;&ndash;it was to be akin to a holy pilgrimage, and
absolution for strange things was granted to the men
who would bear arms and hold the quest as secret.</p>
<p>Most of them thought the patron was to be Mother
Church, and regarded it as a certain entrance to Paradise.
Don Ruy himself meekly accepted a role of
the least significance:&ndash;&ndash;a mere seeker of pleasure
adventures in the provinces! It would not be well
that word of risk or danger be sent across seas&ndash;&ndash;and
the Viceroy could of course only say &ldquo;god speed
you&rdquo; to a gentleman going for a ride with his servants
and his major domo.</p>
<p>And thus:&ndash;&ndash;between a hair brained adventurer
and a most extolled priest, began the third attempt to
reach the people called by New Spain, the Pueblos:&ndash;&ndash;the
strangely learned barbarians who dwelt in walled
towns&ndash;&ndash;cultivating field by irrigation, and worshipping
their gods of the sun, or the moon, or the stars
through rituals strange as those of Pagan Egypt.</p>
<p>Word had reached Mexico of the martyrdom of
Fray Juan Padilla at Ci-bo-la, but in the far valley
of the Rio Grande del Norte&ndash;&ndash;called by the tribes
the river P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute;,&ndash;&ndash;Fray Luis de Escalona might
be yet alive carrying on the work of salvation of souls.</p>
<p>The young Spanish adventurer listened with
special interest as the devotion and sacrifices of Fray
Luis were extolled in the recitals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he lives we will find that man,&rdquo; he determined.
&ldquo;He was nobly born, and of the province of my
mother. I&rsquo;ve heard the romance for which he
cloaked himself in the gray robe. He should be a
prince of the church instead of a wandering lay
brother&ndash;&ndash;we will have a human thing to search for
in the world beyond the desert&ndash;&ndash;ours will be a
crusade to rescue him from the infidel lands.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE STORY BY THE DESERT WELL</h3>
</div>
<p>Don Diego marvelled much at the briskness
of the plans for a season of hunting ere
his troublesome charge was well able to see
out of both eyes. But on being told that the range
might be wide, he laid in a goodly stock of quills and
parchment, for every league of the land would bring
new things to his knowledge.</p>
<p>These records were to be entitled &ldquo;Relaciones of
the New and Wondrous Land of the Indian&rsquo;s Island&rdquo;
and in those Relaciones the accounts of Padre Vicente
were to loom large. Among the pagan people his
war against the false gods had been ruthless. Maestro
Diego was destined to hear more of the padre&rsquo;s
method than he dared hope in the earlier days.</p>
<p>Jos&eacute;, the Indian of the North whose Te-hua name
was Khen-zah, went with them&ndash;&ndash;also his wife&ndash;&ndash;the
only woman, for without her the man would not go in
willingness. Two only were the members added by
Don Ruy to the cavalcade&ndash;&ndash;one a stalwart fellow
of many scars named Juan Gonzalvo who had known
service with Pizarro in the land of gold&ndash;&ndash;had lost
all his coin in an unlucky game, and challenged the
young stranger from Seville for the loan of a stake to
gamble with and win back his losses. He looked
good for three men in a fight. Instead of helping
him in a game, Don Ruy invited him on the hunting
trip!</p>
<p>The other addition was as different as might be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
from the toughened, gambling conquistador&ndash;&ndash;a mere
lad, who brought a letter from the hand of the Viceroy
as a testimonial that the lad was a good scribe if
it so happened that his sanctity the padre&ndash;&ndash;or his
Excellency Don Ruy, should need such an addition in
the new lands where their hunting camps were to be.
The boy was poor but for the learning given him by
the priests,&ndash;&ndash;his knowledge was of little save the
knowledge of books. But his willingness to learn
was great, and he would prove of use as a clerk or
page as might be.</p>
<p>Padre Vicente was not present, and the cavalcade
was already two days on the trail, but Don Ruy read
the letter, and looked the lad over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name is&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manuel Lenares&ndash;&ndash;and called &lsquo;Chico&rsquo; because
I am not yet so tall as I may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be Manuella because you look not yet
so manlike as you may be,&rdquo; declared Ruy Sandoval,&ndash;&ndash;and
laughed as the angry color swept the face of
the lad. &ldquo;By our Lady, I&rsquo;ve known many a dame
of high degree would trade several of her virtues for
such eyes and lips! Tush&ndash;&ndash;boy! Have no shame
to possess them since they will wear out in their own
time! I can think of no service you could be to me&ndash;&ndash;yet&ndash;&ndash;I
have another gentleman of the court with
me holding a like office&ndash;&ndash;Name of the Devil:&ndash;&ndash;it
would be a fine jest to bestow upon him a helper for
the ponderous &lsquo;Relaciones&rsquo;!&rdquo; and Don Ruy chuckled
at the thought, while the lad stood in sulky embarrassment&ndash;&ndash;willing
to work, but not to be laughed
at.</p>
<p>He was dressed as might be in the discarded garments
of magnificence, well worn and visibly made
over to fit his young figure. His cloak of old scarlet,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
too large for him, covered a patched shirt and jacket,
and reached to his sandal straps of russet leather:&ndash;&ndash;scarce
the garb of a page of the Viceregal court, yet
above that of the native servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are&ndash;&ndash;Spanish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the face of the youth flushed, and he shrugged
his shoulders and replaced his velvet cap with its
pert cock&rsquo;s feather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have more than enough Spanish blood to send
me to the Christian rack or stake if they caught me
worshipping the pagan gods of my grandmother,&rdquo; he
stated briefly, and plainly had so little hope of winning
service that he was about to make his bow and depart
in search of the Padre.</p>
<p>But the retort caught Don Ruy, and he held the lad
by the shoulder and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all good things the saints could send, you are
the best,&rdquo; he decided&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and by that swagger I&rsquo;ll be
safe to swear your grandsire was of the conquistadores&ndash;&ndash;I
thought so! Well Chico:&ndash;&ndash;you are engaged
for the service of secretary to Maestro Diego Maria
Francisco Brancadori. You work is seven days in the
week except when your protector marks a saint&rsquo;s day
in red ink. On that day you will have only prayers
to record, on the other days you will assist at many
duties concerning a wondrous account of the adventures
Don Diego hopes for in the heathen land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hopes for:&ndash;&ndash;your Excellency?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hopes for so ardently that our comfort may rest
in seeing that he meets with little of disappointment
on the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one instant the big black eyes of the lad flashed
a shy appreciation of Don Ruy&rsquo;s sober words and
merry smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For it is plain to be seen,&rdquo; continued that gentleman&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
if Don Diego finds nothing to make
record of, your own wage will be a sad trial and expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, your Excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will receive the perquisites of a secretary if
you have indeed understanding,&rdquo; continued Don Ruy,
&ldquo;but if there are no records to chronicle you will get
but the pay of a page and no gifts to look for. Does
it please you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is more than a poor lad who owns not even a
bedding blanket could have hoped for, se&ntilde;or, and I
shall earn the wage of a secretary. That of a page
I could earn without leaving the streets and comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; And again the eyes of Don Ruy wandered
over the ill garbed figure and tried to fit it to the
bit of swagger and confidence.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I guessed at your
grandfather&ndash;&ndash;now I&rsquo;ll have a turn at you:&ndash;&ndash;Is it a
runaway whom I am venturing to enroll in this respectable
company of sober citizens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Excellency!&rdquo; the lad hung his head yet
watched the excellency out of the corner of his eye,
and took heart at the smile he saw&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;it is indeed
true there are some people I did not call upon to say
farewell ere offering my services to you, but it is plain
to see I carried away not any one&rsquo;s wealth in goods
and chattals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is easily to be perceived,&rdquo; said Don Ruy and
this time he did not laugh, for with all his light heart
he was too true a gentleman to make sport of poverty
such as may come to the best of men. &ldquo;By our Lady,
I&rsquo;ve a feeling of kinship for you in that you are a
runaway indeed&ndash;&ndash;this note mentions the teaching of
the priests&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll warrant they meant to make a monk
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If such hopes are with them, they must wait until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
I am born again,&rdquo; decided the lad, and again Don Ruy
laughed:&ndash;&ndash;the lad was plainly no putty for the
moulding, and there was chance of sport ahead with
such a helper to Maestro Diego.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be my charge to see that you are not over
much troubled with questions,&rdquo; said his employer, and
handed back the letter of commendation. &ldquo;None
need know when you were engaged for this very important
work. Jos&eacute; over there speaks Spanish as
does Ysobel his wife. Tell them you are to have a
bed of good quality if it be in the camp&ndash;&ndash;and to take
a blanket of my own outfit if other provisions fall
short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A muttered word of thanks was the only reply, and
Don Ruy surmised that the boy was made dumb by
kindness when he had braced himself for quips and
cuffs&ndash;&ndash;knowing as he must&ndash;&ndash;that he was light of
build for the road of rough adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho!&ndash;&ndash;Lad of mine!&rdquo; he called when the youth
had gone a few paces&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I trust you understand that
you travel with a company of selected virtues?&ndash;&ndash;and
that you are a lucky dog to be attached to the most
pious and godly tutor ever found for a boy in Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to be called neighbor of these same virtues
that I have come begging a bed on the sand when I
might have slept at home on a quilt of feathers:&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the
lad&rsquo;s tongue had found its use again when there
was chance for jest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes:&ndash;&ndash;your Excellency?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to that pagan grandmother of whom you
made mention:&ndash;&ndash;her relationship need not be widely
tooted through a horn on the journey&ndash;&ndash;yet of all
things vital to the honorable Maestro Diego and his
&lsquo;Relaciones,&rsquo; I stand surety that not any one thing will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
be given so much good room on paper as the things
he learns of the heathen worship of the false gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nod is as good as a wink to a mule that is
blind!&rdquo; called back the lad in high glee. &ldquo;Happy
am I to have your excellency&rsquo;s permission to hold discourse
with him concerning the church accursed lore
of our ancestral idols!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he joined Jos&eacute; and Ysobel as instructed, and
gave the message as to bed and quarters. Jos&eacute; said
no word in reply, but proceeded to secure blankets,
one from the camp of Don Ruy. Ysobel&ndash;&ndash;a Mexican
Indian&ndash;&ndash;who had been made Christian by the
padre ere she could be included in the company, was
building a fire for the evening meal. Seeing that it
burned indifferently the new page thrust under the
twigs the fine sheet of paper containing the signature
of the Viceroy.</p>
<p>Ysobel made an exclamation of protest&ndash;&ndash;but it
was too late&ndash;&ndash;it had started the blaze in brave order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your letter&ndash;&ndash;if you should need it&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
for the padre!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest you easy, Nurse,&rdquo; said the lad and stretched
himself to watch the supper cooked. &ldquo;I have no
further needs in life but supper and a bed,&ndash;&ndash;see to it
that Jos&eacute; makes it near you own! I am in the employ
of Don Ruy Sandoval for a period indefinite.
And he has promised&ndash;&ndash;laugh not out loud Ysobel!&ndash;&ndash;that
he will see to it I am not questioned as to
whence or why I came to seek service under his banner!&ndash;&ndash;even
the holy father is set aside by that
promise&ndash;&ndash;I tell you that laughter is not to be allowed!
If you let him see that you laugh, I will beat
you when we are alone, Ysobel&ndash;&ndash;I will though you
have found a dozen husbands to guard you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ruy did see the laughter of the woman, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
was well pleased that the lad could win smiles from all
classes,&ndash;&ndash;such a one would lighten weary journeys.</p>
<p>He felt that he had done well by Maestro Diego.
Plainly the quick wit of the lad betokened good blood,
let him prate ever so surely on his heathen grandmother!</p>
<p>Don Diego felt much flattered at the consideration
shown by Don Ruy for the &ldquo;Relaciones&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;in fact
he had so pleased an interest in the really clever young
pen-man that the Padre took little heed of the boy&ndash;&ndash;he
was of as much account as a pet puppy in the expedition&ndash;&ndash;but
if the would-be historian needed a
secretary&ndash;&ndash;or fancied he did,&ndash;&ndash;the lad would be
less trouble than an older man if circumstances should
arise to make trouble of any sort.</p>
<p>So it chanced that Juan Gonzalvo and Manuel Lenares,
called Chico, were the only two included in the
company who had not been confessed and enrolled by
Padre Vicente himself.</p>
<p>It was the magic time of the year, when new leaves
open to the sun, and the moon, even in the bare desert
stretches of the land, brought dreams of Castile to
more than one of the adventurers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Father,&rdquo; said Don Ruy with feigned complaint,
&ldquo;Think you not that your rigid rules for the
journey might have stopped short of hopeless celibacy
for all of us?&ndash;&ndash;Why a moon like that and Venus ascendent
unless to make love by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brightness of that same moon saved you
nothing of a cracked pate the hour of fortune when
we first met,&rdquo; observed Padre Vicente drily.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Maids
or matrons on the journey would have
caused broken heads in the desert as handily as in the
city streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the faith&ndash;&ndash;your words are of wisdom and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
much to be valued by his highness,&rdquo; agreed Don
Diego. &ldquo;Make note of that thought for the Relaciones
Chico, my son. This pious quest may be a
discipline of most high import to all of us. Wifeless
should we ride as rode the crusaders of an older day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tum-a-tum-tum!&rdquo; Don Ruy trolled a fragment
of love melody, and laughed:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I have no fancy
for your penances. Must we all go without sweethearts
because you two have elected to be bachelors
for the saving of souls? Think you the Indian maids
will clamor for such salvation? I lay you a wager,
good father, that I win as many converts with love
songs and a strip of moonlight, as do you both with
bell and book!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Around the camp fires of the nights strange tales
were told&ndash;&ndash;and strange traits of character unconsciously
given to the light, and to all the far seeing
Padre gave note;&ndash;&ndash;in emergencies it is ever well to
know one&rsquo;s resources.</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; the Te-hua slave&ndash;&ndash;caught first by the Navahu&ndash;&ndash;traded
to the Apaches&ndash;&ndash;thence to neighbors of
the south&ndash;&ndash;after years of exile, was the one who had
but few words. All the queries of the adventurers
as to gold in the north gained little from him&ndash;&ndash;only
he remembered that fine yellow grains were
in some streams, and it was said that other yellow
metal was in secret places, but he did not profess to
be a knower of High Things&ndash;&ndash;and it was half a life
time since his eyes had rested on his own people.</p>
<p>He was a silent man whose words were in the main
for his Ysobel and the boy secretary. But the gold
nugget worn smooth in the pocket of Padre Vicente
was as a charm to find its parent stock in all good
time! Men were with them who knew minerals in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
other lands!&ndash;&ndash;It would go hard but that it should be
found!</p>
<p>He willingly let the nugget pass from hand to hand:&ndash;&ndash;it
was restful as sleep to make the trail seem short.
To Don Ruy he had told somewhat of its finding, and
the story in full was promised some day to the cavalcade.</p>
<p>And at Ah-ko where they rested&ndash;&ndash;they had not
halted at hostile Ci-bo-la!&ndash;&ndash;At Ah-ko where the
great pool on the high mesa made glad their eyes, and
the chiefs came to pay ceremonial visits, and the men
felt they were nearing the end;&ndash;&ndash;there, at the urging
of Don Ruy who deemed it worthy of the &ldquo;Relaciones&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;there
was told the story of the bit of gold,
the Symbol of the Sun, as it had been told to Padre
Vicente years before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;I did mean to tell you of the finding of
it,&rdquo; he announced amiably. &ldquo;I have listened to all
your discourses and romances on the journey&ndash;&ndash;and
good ones there were among them! But mine would
not have been good to tell when seeking recruits, it
might have lessened their ardor&ndash;&ndash;for a reason you
will shortly perceive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I plainly perceive already that the good father
has saved us thus far from a fright!&rdquo; decided Don
Ruy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since a man lived through it you can perhaps endure
the telling of it&ndash;&ndash;even here in the half darkness,&rdquo;
said the priest, and noted that Don Diego was
sharpening a pen, and Chico taking an ink horn from
his pocket. The journal of the good gentleman had
grown to be one of the joyful things of the journey,
and the more gay adventurers gave him some wondrous
tales to include.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a pretty tale, but it may teach you somewhat
of these brown people of the stone houses&ndash;&ndash;and
some of the meaning back of their soft smiles! It is
not a new tale of to-day:&ndash;&ndash;it goes back to the time
when the vessels of Narvaez went to the bottom and
a few men found their way westward to Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De Vaca and his men?&rdquo; said Don Diego. But
the priest shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Earlier than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Earlier? Holy Father:&ndash;&ndash;how could that be
when no others&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me:&ndash;&ndash;you are about to say no others
escaped, are you not? Have you forgotten De Vaca&rsquo;s
own statement as to two other men who went ashore
before the sinking of the vessels, and who were never
heard of again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of it with great special interest,&rdquo;
announced Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;heard it in the monastery
on the island of Rhodes where the white man you
speak of (for one of the lost ones was a negro) had
as a boy been trained in godly ways by the Knights
of St. John. There the good fathers also educated
me as might be and tried with all zeal to make a monk
of me! Ever before my mind was held the evil end
of the other youth who fled from the consecrated robe,&ndash;&ndash;for
he had made a scandal for a pretty nun ere he
became a free lance and joined hands with Solyman
the Magnificent against Christendom,&ndash;&ndash;oh&ndash;&ndash;many
and long were the discourses I had to listen to of that
heretic adventurer! He was a Greek of a devout and
exalted Christian family, and his name was Don
Teodore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juan Gonzalvo&ndash;&ndash;called Capitan Gonzalvo in favor
of his wide experience and wise management of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
camp, had been resting idly on the sands, but sat up,
alert at that name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy name of God:&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; and his words were low
and keen as though bitten off between his teeth&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;is
he then alive? Good Father&ndash;&ndash;was it he? and
is he still alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While one might count ten, Padre Vicente looked
in silence at the tense, eager face of his questioner,
and the others stared also, and felt that a spark had
touched powder there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes:&ndash;&ndash;it is true. It was that man,&rdquo; said the
priest at last. &ldquo;But why do you, my son, wake up at
the name? May it be that the Greek was dear to
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He should be dear should I find him, or any of
his blood!&rdquo; But the voice of the careless adventurer
was changed and was not nice to hear. &ldquo;All the
gold the new land could give me would I barter but
to look on the face of Don Teo, the renegade
Greek!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not in friendship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juan Gonzalvo laughed, and Don Diego crossed
himself at that laugh,&ndash;&ndash;it had the mockery of hell in
it, and the priest turned and gave the heretofore careless
fellow a keener attention than had previously
occurred to him. By so little a thing as a laugh had
the adventurer lifted himself from the level where he
had been idly assigned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not look on his face in this world, my
son,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;and enmities should cease at
the grave. The man is dead. You could have been
but a child when he left Spain, what evil could have
given him your hate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father was one of the Christian slaves chained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
by him to the oars of Solyman the infidel Turk!
Long days and horrible nights was he witness to the
lives of Solyman the magnificent, and Don Teodore
the fortunate. When the end came,&ndash;&ndash;when the magnificent
patron began to set spies on his favorite lady
of the harem, the tricky Greek escaped one dark night,
and brought up in Barcelona as an escaped slave of
the Turk, pretending he had eluded the swords of the
oppressor after dreadful days of bondage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember that time,&rdquo; said Don Diego. &ldquo;He
was entertained by the nobles, and plied with questions,
and was offered a good office in the next crusade
against the unsanctified infidels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was told to me,&rdquo; said Juan Gonzalvo&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;told
by a man whose every scar spoke of the Greek
wolf! I was told of them as other children are told
the stories of the blessed saints. My first toy sword
was dedicated to the cutting down of that thrice accursed
infidel and all his blood. God:&ndash;&ndash;God:&ndash;&ndash;how
mad I was when I was told the savages of the
new world had done me wrong by sending him to hell
before I could even spell his name for curses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son! You are doing murder in your heart!&rdquo;
and Padre Vicente held up the crucifix with trembling
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I am!&rdquo; agreed Gonzalvo and laughed, and
laid himself down again to rest on his saddle.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Does
it call for penance to kill a venomous thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A human soul!&rdquo; admonished the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he came by such soul later in life than his
record shows trace of!&rdquo; declared Juan Gonzalvo, and
this time the priest was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth, report does stand by our friend in that,&rdquo;
agreed Don Diego. &ldquo;He lived as a Turk among
the Turkish pirates, and was never so much a Christian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
as are those who serve as devils, in the flames of
the pit. To slay the infidel is not to slay a soul, good
father,&ndash;&ndash;or&ndash;&ndash;if you are of that mind,&rdquo; he added
with an attempt at lightness which sat ill on him&ndash;&ndash;so
stiff it was as he eyed the still priest warily,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;if
you are of that mind, we can never grow dull for argument
in the desert marches. In the Holy Office
godly men of the Faith work daily and nightly on that
question even now in Christian Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest shuddered, and fingered his beads.
Well they knew in those days the &ldquo;question&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Holy office&rdquo; in Christian Spain. The rack loomed
large enough to cast its shadow even to the new found
shores at the other side of the world!</p>
<p>And plainly he read also that two otherwise genial
gentlemen of the cavalcade were equipped well for all
fanatic labor where Holy Cross or personal hates
were to be defended. It is well to know one&rsquo;s comrades,
and the subject of the Greek had opened doors
of strange revelation to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mind which is of God and of the Holy
Mother Church is the mind for the judgments of
souls,&rdquo; said Padre Vicente after a silence. &ldquo;We may
thank the saints that we are not called on to condemn
utterly any of God&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what of the Devil&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Don Diego
plainly not satisfied with the evasive reply where he
had least expected it. &ldquo;What of the children of the
darkness and the Evil One?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Padre Vicente, of the wild tribes, looked around the
group and smiled. Scarce a man of them without at
least one lost life to his record&ndash;&ndash;and more than one
with murders enough on his list to have won him
sainthood if all had been done for the Faith:&ndash;&ndash;which
they were not! Back of them crouched dusky
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
Indians of the village, watching with eager yet apparently
kindly interest, this after supper talk of the
strange white men of the iron and the beasts, who had
come again to their land. The priest made a cigarro&ndash;&ndash;then
another one, lit both and passed the first made
to the oldest chief&ndash;&ndash;the Ruler of the Indian group.
The Indian accepted it with a breath of prayer on
the hand of the reverend father, and the latter sent
out smoke in a white cloud ere speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every brown skin here is a worshipper of false
gods, and is therefore a son of Beelzebub&ndash;&ndash;yet to
slaughter them for that won no favors for the last
Capitan-General who led an army across this
land,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;and mine must not be the task
to judge of their infidelity to the Saints or to Christ
the Son who has not yet spoken to them!&rdquo; The
words were uttered with an air of finality. Plainly
he did not mean to encourage blood lust unless necessary
to the work in hand. Don Diego sulkily made
the sign of the cross at the Name, and Don Ruy noted
that the good father was good on the parry&ndash;&ndash;and if
he could use a blade as he did words, he would be a
rare fencer for sport. One could clang steel all day
and no one be the bearer of a scratch!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the illustrious and much sought for Greek
is without doubt serving his master as a flame in hell,
it would add sweetness to a fair night if you would
tell us how he fared at the hands of his brown
brothers,&rdquo; suggested Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and how the Devil
found his own at last. These others will be much
entertained to hear what share he had in the finding
of the gold. Strange it is that I never thought to
ask the name of the man&ndash;&ndash;or you to tell it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest hesitated ever so slightly. Was he of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
two minds how much to tell these over eager adventurers?
Especially that one of the curses! But the
truth, as he had told Don Ruy in part, was an easier
thing to maintain, and keep memory of, than a fiction
dressed up for the new man. And the man was
watching him with compelling eyes, and the boy Chico,
with eyes agog, was also alert for his endless notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he had to do with the gold&ndash;&ndash;much!&rdquo; he
said at last. &ldquo;He was the only white man who had
been told the secret of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah-la-la!&rdquo; murmured Don Ruy, plainly suggesting
that such evidence would be the better for a trusty
witness.&ndash;&ndash;Padre Vicente heard him, and puffed his
cigarro, and half closed his eyes in his strange patient,
pale smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is true for all that!&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;And
of all places we have crossed since Culiacan was left
behind us, none seems more fitting than this for the
telling of his story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes glanced over the men circled above the
great pool. The stars were making little points of
light in the rock bound water. Far below in the
desert a coyote called to his intimates. Indians
loitered at the edge of the circle. And at the rim of
of the mesa, and high places of the natural fortress,
armed sentinels paced;&ndash;&ndash;dusk figures against the far
sky. It was truly a place made for tales of adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever evil your much hated Greek was guilty
of, there is one question to ask:&ndash;&ndash;in monk&rsquo;s cell, or
in the battles for the wrong&ndash;&ndash;left he the record of a
coward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; acknowledged Don Diego&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but his zeal
was damnable in all things.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I ask because various things which he endured
could scarcely be understood if you put him in the
list of the weak or the incapable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often the strength of the Evil One is a stupendous
force for his chosen people,&rdquo; agreed Don Diego.
&ldquo;That is widely known in Europe to-day when Paracelsus
with infernal magic of the mind makes
cures which belong by every right to the saints
alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the people are truly cured of their ills&ndash;&ndash;truly
healed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their bodies are truly healed for the life that is
temporal, but each soul is doomed for the life that is
eternal. No Christian doubts that the mental magic
of the physician is donated by Beelzebub whose tool
he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a student of exceeding depth,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;agreed
Padre Vicente&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and it may be he has found magic
forbidden to man. But the Greek laid claim to no
such power as that, however much it is said that the
devil loved him! He had only a strong body, and
the dislike to see it cut to pieces for a heathen holiday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De Soto, it is said, found a dirk of his when he
crossed the land of Apalache years later, seeking empire.
But the tribes could or would tell nothing of
the lost Greek and the negro slave. The latter was
killed by the people called Natchez, and the Greek,
who had been among many things:&ndash;&ndash;a sailor,
escaped by the water, leaving no trail&ndash;&ndash;not even the
trail made by a white skin in a land of dusk people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the Turks he had learned a trick of using
stain of barks and herbs. His hair was of brown,
but the eyebrows and lashes were heavy and dark.
After using such concoction, a mirror of clear water
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
showed him no trace of himself except the eyes&ndash;&ndash;they
were blue beyond hope, but the heavy lashes were
a help and a shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With stolen arms of bow, hatchet, and a flint
knife, the man went north&ndash;&ndash;wading the river edge
at night, and hiding by day until the land of the
Natchez was left behind. A strong river came from
the west&ndash;&ndash;and an old canoe gave him hope of finding
New Spain by the water course. That journey was
a tedious thing of night prowlings, hidings, and,
sometimes starvings. Then the end of solitude came,
and he was captured by heathen rangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were a large company and were travelling
west. Later he learned they were a war company and
in a fight his master and most of the others were
killed. At the rejoicing of the victors, he sang
louder, and danced more wildly than all the others,
so they did not kill him. He was traded to other
Indians further west for a painted robe and some
clay pots. This last move brought him to the villages
of the stream, named later by Coronado the Rio
Grande, but called by the Indians another name, the
P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very villages where we are to go?&rdquo; demanded
Don Ruy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly some of the same,&rdquo; said the priest.
&ldquo;How many of you remember the great comet of
1528?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several did, and all remembered the dread and
horror it spread in Western Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you then what that same threat in the sky
must have been to these wild people who seek magic
ever from the stars and even the clouds. It was a
threat and it called for some sacrifice propitiating the
angry gods.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sacrifice? Do these infidels then practise such
abominations?&rdquo; asked Don Diego.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To look at the mild eyes and hear their soft
voices of these our guests it is not easy to think it,&rdquo;
agreed Padre Vicente, &ldquo;but these people are but the
northern cousins of the men Cortez conquered&ndash;&ndash;their
customs differ only in degree. To both Venus
and Mars were human god-offerings made&ndash;&ndash;that
day of sacrifice is not so long past, and in that day it
was done here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your lucky Greek was the one to be chosen!
He was fed well as one would fatten an ox for the
knife. He had some knowledge of simple remedies,
and in brewing herbs for their sick he had also stolen
the opportunity for the further addition to his coat
of color. He was to them an Indian of an unknown
tribe, yet, since he was to be offered to the gods, he
was made the very center of ceremonial dances, and
infernal heathenish customs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both men and women enter into certain sacred&ndash;&ndash;or
infernal orders, whose ceremonies are only known
to those initiate. An inter-tribal connection is kept
up in such societies between villages speaking a totally
different language,&ndash;&ndash;even though the tribes be
at war, there is always a truce for these wild creatures
who dance together for some magic, or some prayer
to their false gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the truce is kept?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would not be possible for a tribe to break truce
of their diabolical things of their spirits. At the
ceremonies for the sacrifice to the comet god was a
girl of another tribe, and when the Greek noted that
her desire was not to see him destroyed, he had the
first glimpse of hope,&ndash;&ndash;the only other he had was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
to remove the stain in some way, and convince them
that their gods had made a miracle to save him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest made a gesture towards the great sand
drifts at every side of rock wall and column.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To which of you would it occur, if hiding meant
chance of life&ndash;&ndash;to which of you would it occur to go
under that sand for days so close to the trail that the
women with the water jars would pass you scores of
times in a day carrying water from this pool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This pool?&ndash;&ndash;this&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the eyes of Don Ruy
lightened&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;this is then that place of the great
danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man could not hide in the sand like that&ndash;&ndash;nor
deceive these wild trailers of animals,&rdquo; decided Don
Diego&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and of a certainty it could not be close to
the trail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we would naturally think,&rdquo; decided Padre
Vicente. &ldquo;But the Indian girl was wiser than our
wisdom, Se&ntilde;or, for she did aid his escape, and she did
hide him there. To get breath, his face was touching
a great wall of rock against which another was carelessly
laid. The place had been chosen with a
knowledge that seemed inspired&ndash;&ndash;for only close to
the trail where the sand was like to be disturbed by
naked romping children,&ndash;&ndash;only there in all these
deserts could he have been hidden from their hunters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here?&ndash;&ndash;in this place?&rdquo; again said Don Ruy.
&ldquo;Holy father it is a good story&ndash;&ndash;yet sounds a romance
fantastic to fit this weird place of the pool and
the star shine of the night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the name of these people, the Queres, and the
name of the village Ah-ko, this should be the place of
the sacrificial intentions,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;By the
careful account given, this is the pool to which the
trail led, and it may even be that the ancient Cacique
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
to whom, but now, I gave the cigarro, was chief priest
of the sacrifice in that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A truly delectable neighbor for a help to pleasant
fancy,&rdquo; said Don Ruy and laughed. &ldquo;If the amiable
devil should be moved to sacrifice now, I would be the
nearest to his hand&ndash;&ndash;think you he would make ill
use of my youth and tenderness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Sanctity, the padre was indeed wise that no
word of this was breathed in the viceregal ears of
Mexico,&rdquo; said Don Diego with a testiness not yet
subdued over the question of utter damnation for the
souls unregenerate. &ldquo;Piety would carry me far&ndash;&ndash;but
no warrant is mine to follow even the Highest
where cannibals do wait for unholy sustenance!&rdquo; and
he arose and bowed to Don Ruy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;&ndash;Name of the Devil!&rdquo; said his noble ward,
and laughed and stretched his legs. &ldquo;I may not be
so unholy as your words would suggest. Give not a
dog a bad name in the days of his youth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at this the scandalized and pious dignitary
multiplied words to make clear how far from such
meaning were his devoted intentions. But if wild
tribes must be fed ere their souls could be reached,&ndash;&ndash;victims
could be found other than the heir of a
duchess!</p>
<p>At which outburst Don Ruy suggested that he save
his pious breath and devote it to prayers, and to take
some of his own medicine by remembrance that soul
of king and soul of peasant weighed the same before
high God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After which devout exhortation from your servant,
good father, we again give ear to the tale of
that devil&rsquo;s disciple&ndash;&ndash;the Greek Teo,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;Did they find him in the sand? And did the merciful
dame hide in the sand also?&ndash;&ndash;if so the prison
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
might not be without hope. Holy Saint Damien!&ndash;&ndash;to
think that the man walked these same stony heights&ndash;&ndash;and
drank from that pool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They never found him in the sand.&rdquo; The priest
ignored the other frivolous comment. &ldquo;They never
found him anywhere, and a slave from the Navahu
people was made a sacrifice in his stead. The strange
girl was a Te-hua medicine maid or magic learner of
things from the wise men of Ah-ko. Her prayers
were very many, and very long, and she made a shrine
for prayer on the sand beside the stone wall where he
was hidden. Their men set watch on her, she knew
it, but not anything did they find but a girl who made
her prayers, and gave no heed to their shadowings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When were ended her days of devotion to the
false gods&ndash;&ndash;then she ate, and drank, and took the
way to her own people; with moderate pace she took
that trail north, but when night came, she ran like
the wild thing she was, again to the south, crept unseen
again into this fortress, and led the rescued man
as far to the west as might be until the dawn came.
With the coming of the sun, came also a sand storm
of great stress, and all trace of their steps were
covered, and the medicine maid saw in that a mystic
meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Turk and Spaniard the refugee might be only
Teo the Greek, a fugitive from all high courts. But
to the Indian he was a lost God of the Great Star for
whom even the desert winds did duty. When with
moistened yucca root he rubbed his hands that the
white skin showed, she bent her head to the sand, and
was his slave until ... the end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It moves well, and beautifully smooth:&ndash;&ndash;this
tale of the outlaw,&rdquo; agreed Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but it is that
end we are eager for&ndash;&ndash;and the how it was compassed&ndash;&ndash;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
she turned slave&ndash;&ndash;or mistress&ndash;&ndash;or both in
one, as alas!&ndash;&ndash;has chanced to men ere our day!&ndash;&ndash;was
the doom expected from the earliest mention of
the pitiful and most devout lady&ndash;&ndash;devout to her
devils! But of the end&ndash;&ndash;the end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end came to him long after they parted, and
for one winter and one summer were their wanderings
to the west. Of the Firebrand river deep between
rock walls he had heard, and of the ocean far beyond,
and of Mexico to the south. To reach the river they
crossed dry leagues of desert and lived as other wild
things lived. But the river was not a thing for boats
or journeys, and they went on beyond it seeking the
sea. Strange things and strange lives they passed on
the way. His skin had been stained many times and
his beard was plucked out as it grew. Enough of
Indian words he learned to echo her own tale to the
brown savages, and the tale was, that they were
medicine people of Te-hua in the land of P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute;,
and that they travelled to the shores of the sea for
dances and prayers to the gods there. And sometimes
food was given them&ndash;&ndash;and some times prayers
were sent in their keeping. Thus was their journey,
until in the south, in the heart of a desert they found
the place of the palms where the fruit was ripe, and
the water comes from warm springs, and looks a
paradise&ndash;&ndash;but is as a hell when the sand storms
come:&ndash;&ndash;and human devils live to the South and by
the Sea of Cortez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They knew nothing of that, it was a place for
rest, and a place of food, and they rested there because
of that, and gathered food for the further
journey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All medicine people of the tribes carry on their
neck or in a pouch at the belt, some sacred things of
their magic practices, and under the palms, when
other amusement was not to be found, it pleased him
to see what his brown girl carried hidden even from
her master. It took much persuasions, for she felt
that evil would happen if it was shown except it be
a matter of ceremony. Then she at last took from
the pouch, salt from a sacred lake, feather and claw
and beak of a yellow bird, a blade of sharpest flint,
and&ndash;&ndash;this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He again held the piece of gold that they might
see it. Even the Indians leaned forward and looked
at it and then eyed the white men and each other in
silence. To them it was &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; as the priest
told the adventurers it had been to the Te-hua girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Greek pirate of the good luck went close
to madness at the certain fact that for months he
had been walking steadily away from the place where
this was found. To the girl it was a sacred thing
hidden in the earth of her land by the sun&ndash;&ndash;and only
to be used for ceremonies. The place where it grew
was a special hidden place of prayer offering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith!&ndash;&ndash;we all must learn prayers enough to
get our share!&ndash;&ndash;if prayer will do the work!&rdquo; said
Don Ruy.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Chico, it means that you get an
Indian primer,&ndash;&ndash;and that you find for me a brown
enchantress. His reverence will grant us all a special
indulgence for hours of the schooling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Don Brancadori sat up very straight and
shook his head at the priest:&ndash;&ndash;so well assured was
he that enough liberties would be taken without the
indulgences of holy church. Moreover it was not
well to put the deviltries of camp in the mind of so
good a lad as Chico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the girl gave to him the gold and told him
its hiding place?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We may say she gave it&ndash;&ndash;thought in truth she
declared it could not be given&ndash;&ndash;it could only be
made a barter of for other medicine, but it must be
strong medicine. The blade of flint was to guard
her magic symbols if need be, and the man, her master,
saw in that moment that the mind he had to deal
with in this matter was an Indian mind, in which there
is not reason. And to find a &lsquo;medicine&rsquo; potent for
charms was a task set for a man in the place of the
palms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then a forgotten thing came into his mind. It
had been a vow made to an enticing creature of San
Lucar. She was also devout as a young nun. The
vow was of a return&ndash;&ndash;and no doubt of other meetings.
The end of it was that she gave him a rosary&ndash;&ndash;(his
first captors coveted that and took care of it).
But also they ate together of fruit, and as both ladies
and gallants do strange things at strange times, the
lady divided the seeds, and counted them seeking a
lucky number or some such freakish quest. And by
the rosary, and by his mother, she made him swear
that when he had found fortune and a plantation
in the new world, he would plant with his own hands
the seeds there, and send for the lady to come by ship
as chatelaine! Failing the plantation, he was to return,
and her own relatives would find on land or sea
an office fit for his talents:&ndash;&ndash;only he was to faithfully
guard the seed of the fruit eaten in a happy
hour, and her prayers would meet his own across the
waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be that women with prayers for him had
not been plentiful&ndash;&ndash;whatever the vow was it was
made and sealed with the prayer of the lady. When
the savages took her rosary they gave no heed to
some brown seeds in a leather pouch&ndash;&ndash;no more of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
them than you could count on your fingers! A man
alone for long in a wilderness gives meaning to things
he would not remember at happier times. And the
training of the Holy Church returns to even the most
gardened men in their hours of stress! So it was
that the prayer of the willing dame kept him company,
as he looked on the seeds. They had become
his rosary&ndash;&ndash;and were the last evidence of the
nightly prayers promised by the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus:&ndash;&ndash;because of their smallness had they been
unnoted of his several captors. Having slipped between
the lining and the cover of the pouch he had
ceased to remember them after the Indian maid
lessened his loneliness. But he went searching for
them now&ndash;&ndash;even one peach seed was still with them&ndash;&ndash;and
some grains of the bearded wheat&ndash;&ndash;that by
a special grace had fallen into a pocket on ship board
while handling grains, and as a jest on himself he
had added it to the others for the plantation to be
made for the waiting dame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could truly say they were &lsquo;medicine&rsquo; given
with prayers. But with forgetfulness of truth, he
also added much as to their divine origin&ndash;&ndash;and the
wondrous power they held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly the Indian girl let go the gold for the
unknown seeds! She further signified that now she
could know always that he was a God, for the gift of
the seeds fitted some myth of her own land&ndash;&ndash;some
thing of one of their false gods who brought seeds
and fruits and great good to the people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that way was made the exchange of medicine
for medicine beside some pool by the palms, and
well it was it was made that day, else never would
we have this golden guide! For:&ndash;&ndash;it fell out that
a day later as he was hunting to the south, he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
surrounded and taken prisoner by the savages who
range by the inland sea of California. The gold had
a hole as you see, he pulled hair from his head, tied
the nugget in the braid, and thus hid it for the next
two years of his life. The girl he never again heard
of. She would die of a certainty alone in the desert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A missionary of our order found the man in the
wilderness. They were exiles, the two for the length
of a winter, and the Greek listened to the tales of the
lost fleet on which Don Teo sought the new
world, and also of the royal order for his arrest following
on the next ship. For a prisoner of Solyman
the Magnificent had escaped from the galleys of the
Turk, and wild tales were told of princes of the North
who gave aid to the traffic in Christian slaves. Don
Teo was by all means to be taken back to Spain that
the Holy Office learn through him the names and
numbers of the offenders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good it is to hear that the varlet was not let sleep
sound all the night!&rdquo; decided Don Ruy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears there were many nights when sleep
kept from him&ndash;&ndash;to judge by his confessions!&rdquo; said
the priest. But to go into deeper hell while he was
yet alive did not march with his wishes, and while
he half inclined to the desert again, that he might
die quietly there as any other starved wild thing does
die:&ndash;&ndash;a thing came which he had not thought:&ndash;&ndash;the
padre died of a serpent&rsquo;s sting, and he, Teo the
Greek, was alone, and apart from the world again!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the gown for which the savages had reverence&ndash;&ndash;and
he took the consecrated robe from the
dead padre and wore it&ndash;&ndash;he had been driven by misfortune
back to Holy Church!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lived under the name of the padre as a priest
in holy orders. His reports to his superior were well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
counterfeited as the writing of the man he had buried.
He held that mission as the extreme outpost for three
years. He died there of a fever, but not until I had
found him, and confessed him. The gold and the
tale of his wanderings he gave to me. Much of it
he told me more than once, for when men are exiles
as he was for those several years, the things of the
old life loom up big with significance. He felt that
he was the <i>finder</i> of <i>the way</i>, and that mayhaps,
Mother Church, so long forgotten by him, would be
the richer that he had lived. Masses were said
for the girl dead in the desert. She had saved him,
and for a little while of life&ndash;&ndash;he had given her
love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have made a most righteous end&ndash;&ndash;since
it was no longer in his power to do evil!&rdquo; commented
Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;But your pirate priest would
never have let go the nugget for masses if the breath
of life had kept him company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows!&ndash;&ndash;the high God does not give us
to see in the heart of the other man,&rdquo; said Padre
Vicente&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;In the years of his trial he was made to
feel his sins against Holy Church&ndash;&ndash;and when the
girl died in the desert, another life died with her.
Even men of sin do give thought to such matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Juan Gonzalvo who hated him, swore at the ill
luck of his escape by death, and no one felt any pity
for that first white pilgrim across the Indian lands.
All of them however gave speech of praise to the
priest&rsquo;s telling of the story. Don Ruy gave him
leave to tell romances in future rather than preach
sermons.</p>
<p>The men were vastly interested to learn at last the
exact region of their destination&ndash;&ndash;and that the province
where the yellow metal had been hidden by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
sun was but a matter now of a few days more of journeying&ndash;&ndash;since
the people of Ah-ko had brother
Queres in settlements adjoining the settlements of
the Te-huas.</p>
<p>So, seeing that the guard was good, and that each
arquebus was near, and in readiness if need be for
dusky visitors, the company fell asleep well content.
Only Don Ruy strolled over the path through the
sand and tried to fancy how the girl and the Greek
had managed the hiding there. A little of the story
had been told him in the monastery when the great
plan had been made, but no names were given, and
the telling of it this night had been a very different
matter&ndash;&ndash;he had so lately crossed the desert where
those two refugees had wandered, that the story had
now a life unknown before. Even the sand billows
and the rock walls of the mesa spoke as with tongues.
The mate to this wonderful Ah-ko could not, he
thought, be in the world any where, and the romance
of the young priestess and the Greek adventurer fitted
the place well and he felt that the priest of the wild
places had chosen rightly in keeping the story until
they had climbed to this place where the story of the
gold had its beginning.</p>
<p>As he retraced his steps, they took him past the
sleeping place of Jos&eacute; and his wife of Mexico. Beside
them was spread the blankets of Chico, but the
lad was not there,&ndash;&ndash;he was standing apart, at the
edge of the sheer cliff, looking out over the desert
reaches where the sand was blue grey in the star light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hollo!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;said Don Ruy and halted in surprise,
&ldquo;do you select sentry duty when you might sleep
soft on the sand? Must I send you another blanket
to woo you to a bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Excellency has been most generous in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
matter of the blanket&ndash;&ndash;one has been enough to keep
record of your kindly heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not enjoy your sleep as a hearty lad
should? Has this place of wonder bewitched you&ndash;&ndash;or
has the story of the Greek and the gold stirred
you into ambitions beyond repose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad might have retorted by reminding Don
Ruy that he also was abroad while his company slept,&ndash;&ndash;usually
a glib pertness would have answered his
employer, but the answer came not readily, and when
it did,&ndash;&ndash;his excellency saw in a surprised moment
that the boy was not such a child as the careless company
fancied him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought nothing of the Greek&ndash;&ndash;and
little of the gold,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But the woman who
followed the love and the man across the deserts&ndash;&ndash;and
who died alone somewhere in the sands like a
starved dog&ndash;&ndash;of her I was thinking! All the magic
she had learned could not save her from hell when
that one man came in her path!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;you are only a lad and may not understand
these things,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;said Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;The girl
may have died like that, it is true, but the hell in the
life she perhaps never got glimpse of,&ndash;&ndash;since she
loved the man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if the dead do know, would not a sort of hell
be hers when she learned she had given the magic
medicine of her God for the idle gift&ndash;&ndash;bestowed
by another mistress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the lad marched to his blankets and wrapped
himself in them, leaving Don Ruy the question to
ponder.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>The rising sun tipped the terraces with gold and
rose, and the nude brown men, and the men children,
faced the east with hands lifted to greet the coming
of the Great Power. This was as it had been since
the time of most ancient days.</p>
<p>But the song chanted from the terrace by the
Woman of the Twilight was a new song, and the men
made their prayers, and wondered at the singer singing
thus on the roof of her dwelling.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>The dew of the hills was on her clothing and on
her hair. She had dreamed a dream and walked in
the night until the words of the dream had come to
her lips, and when they came she sang them aloud and
the people listened, and the men went from their
prayers and thought about it.</p>
<p>Many were conscious of secret thoughts of dread
at the coming of the strangers. The priestess had
spoken of the thing no one had given voice to.</p>
<p>From the day when her son had been honored as
Po-Ahtun-ho, the strife of existence seemed ended
for S[=aa]-hanh-que-ah. The thing she had lived to see
was now accomplished. Her days were now the
gray days of rest and of mystery. She made many
prayers alone in the hills, and forgot to eat.</p>
<p>She was not old, yet to Tahn-t&eacute; she said, &ldquo;It is
over:&ndash;&ndash;The time is come when you stand alone to
be strong. Your work is now the work of the strong
man, and I go to make prayers in the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she stayed over long, he sought her out lest
ill should come to her, and more than once he had
walked into the village with his mother in his arms
as other people carried the little children. It was
the Woman of the Twilight, and no one laughed.
At any other woman they would have laughed to see
her carried in the arms of a man.</p>
<p>And so, when she stood on her terrace and spoke
of the voice of the Dawn and the Mountain Mists,
all listened. The men talked of it in the kivas of
each clan, and the women talked all together, and
were glad. They did not know quite what their fear
had been, but it was no longer with them since the
woman of the God Thoughts said the voices sang
no fear.</p>
<p>Only Yahn Tsyn-deh on the terrace opposite, strung
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
together claws of birds for a necklace, and scoffed
warily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only if you are mountain strong need you have
no fear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The promise that her son is
maybe the Voice and the Dawn is a good promise&ndash;&ndash;but
the wise woman of the hill caves is double wise!
Her song has double thoughts. Be you all mountain
strong, as gods are strong, and no fear will come!
But if the mountain strength waits not at your door&ndash;&ndash;what
then happens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one knew, and the women looked at each other
in question. The peace of the wise woman&rsquo;s
words was killed by the bitter laugh of Apache
Yahn.</p>
<p>When the bitter mood touched the girl, the Te-hua
people remembered that her mother was of that wild
Apache people&ndash;&ndash;enemy to all. At times she could
be a maid like other maids&ndash;&ndash;with charm and
laughter&ndash;&ndash;a very bewitching Yahn who made herself
a beauty barbaric with strings of gay berries of
the rose, or flat girdles of feathers dyed like the rainbow.
Her bare arms had bracelets of little shells.
Into the weaving of her garments she had put threads
of crimson in strange patterns&ndash;&ndash;they were often the
symbols of the Apache gods or spirit people, and
when she chose she made the other women feel fear
with them. Her own mother who told her of them,
would not have worn them thus&ndash;&ndash;but Yahn was
more Apache than her mother.</p>
<p>One woman shelling corn for the meal, suggested
that if the Te-hua people had not mountain strength
it might mean war as the people to the South had
endured that other time&ndash;&ndash;when the men at Tiguex
were burned to ashes by the strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wise S&auml;h-pah!&rdquo; and Yahn laughed at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
late thought,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Has the thing at last come to the
mind of one of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of it also,&rdquo; said one of the other
women sulkily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ai:&ndash;&ndash;you all thought&ndash;&ndash;but none of you dared
say words while the new Ruler and the wise governor
kept silent to the people!&rdquo; she taunted them. &ldquo;Of
all the women I only can speak in the speech of the
strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you we will see them?&rdquo; asked one girl
doubtfully&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;will we not all be sent to the hills the
days when they come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other villages they did so in that long ago
day&ndash;&ndash;some men never let their women be seen of
the white men who wore the iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not be sent to the hills,&rdquo; decided Yahn.
&ldquo;From Ke-yemo and from Tahn-t&eacute; I know their
words. I will talk for the strangers. I will learn
many things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was it you learn so much?&rdquo; asked S&auml;h-pah
jealously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little&ndash;&ndash;little at a time all these years!&rdquo; declared
Yahn in triumph. &ldquo;Tahn-t&eacute; wanted not to
forget it&ndash;&ndash;so he said to me the words&ndash;&ndash;now they
are mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The women regarded her with a wonder that was
almost awe,&ndash;&ndash;there might be something infernal and
unlucky in talking two ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it be war, think you Ka-yemo will be the war
chief as he has been made?&rdquo; queried S&auml;h-pah.
&ldquo;He will be made second if there is fighting,&ndash;&ndash;think
you not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yahn apparently did not think, but she did listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know how it was with his father Awh-we&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
said one. &ldquo;In that day of trial he failed that once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
in the battle with the Yutah. The old men let him
pull weeds in the corn when the next war came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strong fingers of Yahn broke the bird&rsquo;s claw,
and she tossed it from the terrace edge, and selected
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the new young wife Koh-p&eacute; may make the
son of his father brave for all that,&rdquo; and S&auml;h-pah
who was not young and not winsome, watched Yahn,
and felt content when she saw the Apache eyes grow
narrow and the teeth set. &ldquo;A wife with many robes
and many strings of shells and blue stones, makes a
man strong to fight for them. Ka-yemo will be a
strong man now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is of my clan&ndash;&ndash;Ka-yemo!&rdquo; said Yahn panting
with pent up fury, &ldquo;he can fight,&ndash;&ndash;all of our
blood can fight!&ndash;&ndash;if the war is here we can show you
of the Panyoo clan how the Tain-tsain clan can fight
with the new enemy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all knew that Yahn Tsyn-deh could indeed
fight, she wore eagle feathers and had a right to wear
them since a season of the hunt on the Navahu border
when a young warrior had stolen her for his lodge,
and with his own club set with flint blades, had she
let his spirit go on the shadow trail, and to her own
village had she brought the scalp and the club, also
his robe and beads of blue and of green stone&ndash;&ndash;and
she made the other women remember it at times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho!&ndash;&ndash;and will it be you who bears a spear and
a shield and a club on that day?&rdquo; asked S&auml;h-pah the
skeptic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fight that day&ndash;&ndash;or any day, as strong as the
fight any man of yours can ever make!&rdquo; This retort
of Yahn was met with half frightened giggles by
the other women. S&auml;h-pah had been unlucky in the
matter of men. Yet, her list of favorites had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
been limited, and the sarcasm of Yahn was understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good there is some one brave to meet the
strangers!&rdquo; and the smile of S&auml;h-pah was not nice.
&ldquo;Maybe you go to ask for a man&ndash;&ndash;maybe it is why
you learn their words&ndash;&ndash;maybe the Tain-tsain clan
will ask for a white man for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When <i>I</i> ask&ndash;&ndash;I will not be made a laugh, and
sent home with a gift,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and the other women
squealed with shrill laughter and had great joy over
the quarrel. The eyes of S&auml;h-pah blazed. She
tried to speak but her fury gave voice only in throaty
growls, and an older woman than all of them stepped
between them in protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To your own houses&ndash;&ndash;all you who would
fight!&rdquo; she decided&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;go fight your own men if
they send you away with gifts, but by my door I do
not want panthers who scream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>S&auml;h-pah sulkily obeyed, and Yahn laughed and
continued her work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not good to laugh when the bad fortune
comes to any one,&rdquo; said the old woman, but Yahn
refused to be subdued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, mother&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she insisted&ndash;&ndash;(all elderly
women are mothers or aunts to village folk)&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;it is
true. When the dance of the corn was here and the
women made choice of their favorites&ndash;&ndash;it is well
known that S&auml;h-pah did follow Phen-tza a long ways.
He laughed at her.&rdquo; Yahn herself laughed as she
told it,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;he laughed and he asked why she comes
so far alone&ndash;&ndash;and he gives her his blanket and goes
away! That is how he takes her for favorite that
day!&ndash;&ndash;he only laughs and let go his blanket to S&auml;h-pah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman put up her hand that her laugh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
be not heard. The humor of primitive people is
not a delicate thing, and that the blandishments of
S&auml;h-pah had been of no use&ndash;&ndash;as was witness the
blanket!&ndash;&ndash;had made many laugh around the night
fires. Yet the old &ldquo;mother&rdquo; thought it not good
that quarrels should grow out of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your heart so bright with happiness that you
understand nothing of the shame another woman may
know, Yahn Tsyn-deh?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she asked seriously.
&ldquo;S&auml;h-pah is of the free woman&ndash;&ndash;and we are not
of her clan to make judgement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak no words to me of a bright heart!&rdquo; said
Yahn, and arose, and went away. Across the roofs
she went to the stairway of her dwelling, where she
had lived alone since the death of her mother. It
was a good room she entered, very white on the walls,
and the floor white also, with the works of her own
fingers on the smoothness of it. In a niche of the
thick wall stood a bronze god, and a medicine bowl
with serrated edges, and a serpent winged and
crowned painted in fine lines to encircle it. On the
wall was a deerskin of intricate ornamentation, good
and soft in the dressing, it was painted in many
symbols of the Apache gods and the prayer thoughts.
From her mother Yahn had learned them and had
painted them in ceremonial colors. The great goddess
of the white shell things&ndash;&ndash;and white flowers&ndash;&ndash;and
white clouds&ndash;&ndash;was there, and the sun god
was also there, and the curve of the moon with the
germ of life in its heart. The morning star was
there&ndash;&ndash;and also the symbol of the messengers from
the gods. Circling all these sacred things was the
blue zig-zag of the sky lightening by which Those
Above send their decrees to earth children who know
the signs, and at each corner the symbols of the Spirit
People were on guard.</p>

<p>S&auml;h-pah had said once that they might be devil
things, and not god things, and Yahn had watched
her chance, and emptied a jar of dirty water on her
head for that, and no more women said things of the
walls of Yahn Tsyn-deh&rsquo;s house. But whether she
deemed them holy or not holy, she hung the necklace
of birds&rsquo; claws under the symbol of the Goddess
Stenaht-lihan, and then prostrated herself and lay in
silence.</p>
<p>After a long time she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this that the Apache blood be not lost in the
flood of a shame! All this that no Te-hua woman
ever again sees that my heart has been sick&ndash;&ndash;all this
that a double curse of&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in the midst of her words of whispered prayer
speech failed her&ndash;&ndash;and tears choked her until she
sobbed for breath. With all her will she wished to
curse some one whom all her woman&rsquo;s heart forbade
her harm!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>SHRINES OF THE SACRED PLACES</h3>
</div>
<p>When new things cast shadows across the
Indian mind, every cloud touching the
moon is watched at its birth and at its first
hours of the circle, also the stars. And for those
other worlds,&ndash;&ndash;the planets&ndash;&ndash;is it their brotherhood
to the earth that is sealed by a living sacrifice
as they come and as they pass again from the visible
path in the sky?</p>
<p>The Reader of the Stars lives often above the mists
of the earth dews. The door of the high priest Po-Ahtun-ho
faces the way of the South that the shadows
of the moon and the shadows also of the sun,
make reckonings for him of that which must be
noted. So it has been since ancient days.</p>
<p>But for the Reader of the Stars there is a door not
like another door; even to the stranger who runs as
in a race, the house of the stars is seen and noted,
and known as the sacred place for high prayer, and
the record of the God things.</p>
<p>In Pu-y&eacute; the Ancient&ndash;&ndash;and the deserted through
centuries, the dwellings of high priests are marked
beyond shadow of doubt, and each Te-hua man
knows as well the dwelling of the Ruler of five centuries
ago in Pu-y&eacute;, as he knows the door of his own
brother across the court of the village. And the
door of the stars is still beautiful there in Pu-y&eacute;.</p>
<p>Day time or night time the lines of ancient dwellings
look ghost-like in their whiteness. Only medicine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
men with prayer rites ever sit alone in the
deserted rooms. The men from the river villages on
the way for the pine of the hills used in their sacred
dances, do halt to scatter prayer meal at sacred places
where the water once ran:&ndash;&ndash;there is ever the hope
that if prayers enough are thought, the springs in the
Mother Mountain may make fertile again the fields
of the high levels,&ndash;&ndash;for in the days of the carving
of Pu-y&eacute; from the white cliffs there were certainly
many streams and wide harvests in the land that is
called now the desert lands.</p>
<p>And to the west is Tse-c[=o]me-u-pi&ntilde;, the sacred
mountain where the lightning plays, and westward
also, but not so far, is the Cave of the Hunters where
prayers are made to the Trues&ndash;&ndash;the guardian spirits
of the Sacred Ways, and the wild things of the forest,
symbolizing sacred ways and sacred colors. These
places of prayer and of sacrifices are here to-day&ndash;&ndash;and
the way to them is marked by the symbols of stars
and of planets&ndash;&ndash;many eyes see them&ndash;&ndash;but the readers
of them are not so many to-day. A Te-hua man
will tell you they are the forgotten records of the Lost
Others&ndash;&ndash;and will sprinkle prayer meal craftily to
make amends for the truth which is half a lie. The
unspoken pagan gods of the Lost Others have endless
life, and eternal youth, in the land.</p>
<p>All is as it was in the ancient day, except that the
dwellings have changed from the ancient places, and
the priests go over more ground to reach the high
places of prayer.</p>
<p>In the valley of the P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute; many vigils were
kept through the nights of the Springtime, as messages
from the south brought word of the steady,
and thus far, harmless advance of the white strangers.
The treachery at Tiguex in the day of Coronado was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
a keen memory. It would take much wisdom to
avoid war with the iron men of the white god, yet
keep their own wives and daughters for their own
tribe.</p>
<p>Many arrows were made&ndash;&ndash;also spears and
shields. Men went hunting and women dried the
meat, pounding it into shreds for the war trail if need
be. From earliest dawn were heard the grinding
songs as the corn of yellow and blue and red and
white was ground by the maidens keeping time to the
ancient carols&ndash;&ndash;and ever above the head of the
worker was hung the sacred and unhusked ear, which,
when resting, she contemplated, kneeling, and the
thought in her heart must be the sacredness of the
life-giving grain, and the prayer of thanks that it
was given by the gods to the people.</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute;, going from the river bath of the dawn,
crossed the terrace of Yahn Tsyn-deh, and caught
brief glance of her face thus lifted above the grinding
stone. The steadiness of the quiet prayer was
contrast decided, compared with the last wild prayer
she had come to make at his feet:&ndash;&ndash;begging for
magic of any nature since the laws of the clans forbade
that she be wife to her cousin to whom she had
given love.</p>
<p>Almost he halted, moved in his mind to speak to
the girl who had been more of comrade than had any
other woman. But he remembered the evil prayer
she had spoken that day, and this was not a time
to give to thought of her anger. It was bad to have
the evil wish of a woman, but to the other man must
go the cares of the village loves and hates. All
things had worked together to make him the wearer
of the white robe&ndash;&ndash;to place him outside the lines of
village joys or sorrows,&ndash;&ndash;his every demand was for
vision of the strongly felt, yet unseen powers. Was
he the son of a god?&ndash;&ndash;as in the heart of him he still
thought:&ndash;&ndash;then to him belonged the fasting and the
prayer of tribal penance, and the loves and the hates
of the children of Te-hua were luxuries not for him.
He was enemy to no man&ndash;&ndash;and he could be lover to
no woman!</p>

<span class='smcap'>Yahn at the Grinding Stone</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Page 112</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>The old men of his own orders had taught him
much of the strength of magic which comes only to
the priest who seeks no earthly mate. But the ten
years of study of the white man&rsquo;s magic as spoken
in their books of their gods, had taught him more.
He had been witness that their gods were strong for
war, and for worldly power. His people had need
of all that power if the strangers came again and
again like this into the country of the P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute;.</p>
<p>The picture of Yahn, kneeling by the fireplace on
the terrace, her eyes lifted to the sacred corn, brought
quickly to him the memory of a more childish Yahn
who was not unhappy even in her wars.</p>
<p>And now&ndash;&ndash;through the madness, which he was
warned came to all men&ndash;&ndash;now she was a woman
through that madness:&ndash;&ndash;and a forsaken woman
whom all Te-hua watched for the revenge she would
take.</p>
<p>They knew Ka-yemo could not marry with the
daughter of his uncle, but they knew also that he
could not be driven into taking the daughter of another
man as wife,&ndash;&ndash;and Yahn knew this also.
Many robes, and blue jewels had weighed down the
love of a boyhood!</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; thought of this, and of the girl, as he
passed through the village to his own dwelling.
Other maids greeted him, and followed him with
kindly eyes. By all women Tahn-t&eacute; was told in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
many ways that the wearer of the white robe need not
live in a lonely house!</p>
<p>Yet he was not lonely, and when the marvels of
the inviting eyes turned towards him, he was always
conscious of an ideal presence as if the god-maid of
the mesa had stepped between, and made harmless
the sorcery of the village daughters by which he
might otherwise have been enveloped.</p>
<p>Once, when he had confessed as much to the
ancient Ruler who had been his guide and guardian,
the old man had voiced approval and interpreted
clearly for him the dream presence which was as a
gift of the gods, and clearly marked him for other
loves than that of an earth maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;if the dreams came like a maid also&ndash;&ndash;but
a maid so fine that it was as a star&ndash;&ndash;or a flower&ndash;&ndash;or
a prayer made human&ndash;&ndash;then&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is like that?&rdquo; asked the old man, and the boy
answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it seems like that&ndash;&ndash;but not when I
awake. Only in my sleep does she come close, yet
that dream has kept guard for me many days until
the others laugh and say I have no eyes to see a
woman, I do see&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is well&ndash;&ndash;it is best of all!&rdquo; said K[=a]-ye-fah,
the Ruler. &ldquo;If my own child had come back to me
I might not have said it is well. My heart would
have wanted to see your children and the children of
K[=a]-ye-povi&ndash;&ndash;I dreamed of that through many harvests&ndash;&ndash;but
it is over now. She did not live. The
trader of robes from the Yutah brought that word,
and it is better that way. I was dying because my
daughter would be slave to Navahu men&ndash;&ndash;and when
word comes that she died as a little child, then the
sun is shining for me again, and I live again. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
always when I think that the little child could be a
woman, then it is good to think that your children
could be her children. Since it is so&ndash;&ndash;so let it be!
The dream maid of the spirit flower, and of the star,
can be my K[=a]-ye-povi, and you will have the mate
no other earth eyes can ever see, and your nights and
your days will not be lonely. Also it will be that
your prayers be double strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that day of talk, the dream maid of Tahn-t&eacute;
had been a more tangible presence&ndash;&ndash;never a woman&ndash;&ndash;never
quite that, but in the smile of certain children
he caught swift glimpse of her face and then
music rang in the rustle of the corn or the rush of the
river. When the dream vision was beyond all measure
sweet, he was certain of the wisdom of the Ancient&ndash;&ndash;for
the dream and the thoughts of prayer were double
strong.</p>
<p>They were double strong that morning as he came
from the river bath, and the face of Yahn&ndash;&ndash;and the
thought of her love&ndash;&ndash;brought strangely that dream
face to him in which there was no madness such as the
Apache had shown him when at his feet in prayer.</p>
<p>The tomb&eacute; sounded softly from a far terrace where
special prayer was being made for the growing things,
gray doves fluttered home with food to their young,
and little brown children&ndash;&ndash;not so much clothed as the
birds!&ndash;&ndash;climbed ladders to look in the dove cotes on
his roof, and see the nurslings there lift clamoring
mouths for worms or other treasure.</p>
<p>A woman weaving a blanket of twisted skins of
rabbits worked in the open with her primitive loom in
an arbor before her door, beside her a man whirled a
distaff and spun the coarse hemp of which the warp
was made. Maids and mothers with water jars on
their heads walked in stately file from a spring near
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
the river&rsquo;s edge&ndash;&ndash;and above all the serene accustomed
life of that Indian village, could be heard the
drone of the grinding songs&ndash;&ndash;in the valley of P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute;
there was ever corn for the grinding, and the
time of hunger had come not often to Povi-whah.</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; felt a certain consciousness of the great content
to which the grinding songs and the steady beat of
the prayer drum made music. He knew better than
the others, the worth of that peace, and quiet plenty,
for to the south he had seen hunger stalk in the trail
of the white conquerors, and no woman weaving a
robe could be sure that it would ever keep her children
from the cold. The men of iron had entered doors
as they chose and carried thence all manner of things
pleasing to their fancy.</p>
<p>But the life of Povi-whah was a different life, and
Tahn-t&eacute; was glad often to know that it was his land.
The great medicine Mesa of the Hearts stood like a
guardian straight to the east and at morning its
shadow touched the terraces.</p>
<p>Strange mystic rites belonged to that place where
the Ancient Others had made high sacrifice. Great
medicine was there for the healing of all the nations&ndash;&ndash;and
the secret of it was with the gods. He was
glad as he looked at it that it was so close to his own
people&ndash;&ndash;if a day of need should come they would
have the sacred place more close than any other
people.</p>
<p>As he breathed a prayer and walked to his own
door he met Po-tzah who was the Feeder of the Wind
that fanned the Wheat. He was the first boy friend
of Tahn-t&eacute; in the valley and always their regard had
been kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a time of much striving and I am glad to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
see you, and see you here at my door,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;
the Ruler. &ldquo;You come from the ceremonial bath
after a night of prayer. I go from the bath for the
making of many days and many nights of prayer. If
my mother should return before I come down from
the mountains&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will be in the house of my wife, and she will
be as our mother,&rdquo; said Po-tzah his friend and clansman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks that it is so in your heart,&rdquo; and Tahn-t&eacute;
took the hand of his friend and breathed upon it.
&ldquo;My mother must not hear much talk of any trouble
to come. If she thought there was danger she would
not go from me, and in council it is decided that when
the men of iron come into the valley, the young wives
and the little maids must live for a season in the ruins
of the wide fields of old, and my mother&ndash;&ndash;the
&lsquo;Woman of the Twilight&rsquo; is to be the keeper of them
there, and they must not be seen of the strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They take many wives&ndash;&ndash;if they find them&ndash;&ndash;and
are strongest?&rdquo; asked Po-tzah thinking of his
own wife of a year, and the little brown babe in its
cradle of willow wands swung from the ceiling of their
home. Tahn-t&eacute; smiled mockingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their priest will tell you they take but one. But
their book where their god speaks, gives to all his
favorites many wives, and helps his favorites to get
them with fighting and much cunning, and in the days
when I was with the christian men who said prayers
to that god, I saw them always live as the book said&ndash;&ndash;and
not as Padre Luis said. That man was a good
man&ndash;&ndash;a better man than his book&ndash;&ndash;He was good
enough to be Indian&ndash;&ndash;for that is what the Castilians
call us&ndash;&ndash;and all our brother tribes.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;They call us the same as the Apache or the Hopi
people?&rdquo; asked Po-tzah in wonder. &ldquo;Why do they
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ancient Father in the Sky has not wished
them to know who we are. He has darkened their
minds when they tried to see. They are very proud&ndash;&ndash;that
people! All they saw that was good in the villages,
they argued long about. They are sure that
some of their tribe in some older day did find our
fathers and teach our people,&ndash;&ndash;in what other way
could we know to spin and weave, and live in good
houses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Priest of the prayers to the mighty Wind of
the Four Ways laughed at the very curious ideas of
the white strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they taught our fathers also to eat when
they were hungered and take wives when the time
came!&rdquo; he scoffed.</p>
<p>While they spoke, Ka-yemo crossed a terrace and
halted to look at them, and Po-tzah commented on
the fine beads now worn by Ka-yemo since he
had taken a wife&ndash;&ndash;but Po-tzah thought the wife very
ugly and very stupid, and he would rather see his own
wife even if her father had been a cripple and a poor
man,&ndash;&ndash;and the girl have never a garment but a poor
one of her own making.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ka-yemo is the most beautiful man in the village,&rdquo;
said Tahn-t&eacute;,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;He has fine looks plenty for
one house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tahn-t&eacute;&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and his friend came more close and
spoke softly, &ldquo;you are Po-Ahtun-ho, and you know
wise things and many things. Do you know enough
to care nothing that Ka-yemo and his friends are not
your friends?&rdquo;</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it that you think in such a way?&rdquo; asked
Tahn-t&eacute; quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows the white strangers will deal with one
man of the tribe if they come,&ndash;&ndash;and that will be
honor for that man. He knows the words of the
strangers. If you were not the most wise he would
be chosen to make all talks, and he would be a great
man. Not much has he said;&ndash;&ndash;but his friends say
things! Already they ask what magic touched the
old men when you were made ruler. They say the
Po-Ahtun-ho for all time was born in the place where
he says prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was not born in this place,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;,
as he looked at the river valley, and remembered the
desert sands of Tusayan, and the island of rock on
which he had lived and been happy once. &ldquo;It is true,
Po-tzah. But the people forget when they say no
other Ruler was born apart from his people. Po-se-yemo
came from a cave in the cliff. He came down
from the mountain to the people. He taught them
to listen to mountain thoughts. I come from a rock
in the desert, and the old men say I brought the Sign
that the god made my way. We are yet young, Po-tzah,
when we are older we will know whether the
way of the gods is the way for this people. I know
the words of Ka-yemo&ndash;&ndash;but they are not to be talked
of. Alone I go to face the Ancient Father&ndash;&ndash;Sinde-h&eacute;si.
I go to the mountain of the Stone Face&ndash;&ndash;I
go to dance the dance for ancient wisdom. The old
men know that the time has come for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone? No one in our day has danced alone
before the faces! No one has danced in that place
since the time of the fire across the sky, and that
dancer did not live. You can dance there&ndash;&ndash;Tahn-t&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can dance there&ndash;&ndash;By the arrow I have said it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His friend looked at him with a strange new regard.
Each knew what it meant to be chosen for that
dance of the ancient days.</p>
<p>There are two things a man may not do and have
breath to live. The sacred arrow is held aloft when
an oath is made. If the thing which he has told is a
false thing the Sun Father gives lightening to the
arrow, and the man of the oath speaks no more, and
lives no more. He dies there in that place. All
Te-hua men can tell you that is how it is. No one
asks another to make an oath.</p>
<p>Also no one asks a medicine man to dance before
the ancient picture of the stone in the hills. Only
the unmated can dance there. It is the dance to the
Supreme Father who is named not often. He is that
One who gives earth creatures to the world without
earth matings. Thus Po-se-yemo, the mountain god,
was given to a maid as her child, and only the eagles
and the shadow of the pi&ntilde;on tree knew. He also
gave the two sons of wonder to the Apache goddess
who slept on the mountain alone under the shadow
of a rock reaching out. Water dripped from that
rock and brought the birth dream, and the dream
came true there in Apache land. Those two sons
became the divine warriors. You can see to-day the
giants who were demons and who were slain by those
two sons who worked together for good on earth.
The blood of the giants flowed through long valleys
and turned to stone, and the heads of the giants are
also stone now, and lie where they were severed from
their bodies in the land of Navahu. Thus it has always
been when the Ancient Father has sent the God-Thought
to the earth. Only the Wind, or the Sun, or
the Mist of the Cloud has been mate to the mother.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
Yet the sons have been strong for magic and works
of wonder.</p>
<p>Thus there has been through the ages, one sacred
place where men may go for highest medicine&ndash;&ndash;if
they go before it is not too late!</p>
<p>Not since these two men were born had a man
danced there, and the last man who did so had danced
without the truth or the faith in his heart. No one
ever knew if he found great medicine dreams, for he
died there. After many days they went&ndash;&ndash;and they
found him dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes:&ndash;&ndash;it is so,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute; the Ruler as he met
the eyes of his friend. &ldquo;All may know that I go to
the fast, and the dance, and that I dance for them.
It will be told from the house tops to-night, but when
it is told I will have reached the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may not dance, but I also will fast, and I will
work with you,&rdquo; said Po-tzah. &ldquo;Others will work
with you when they know. Speak for our children
to the god!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he breathed on the hand of Tahn-t&eacute; who was
to do high work and high penance for the tribe, and
Tahn-t&eacute; felt glad music in his heart because of the
words of his friend, and when he laid aside his white
robe and left his house, he spoke to no other man,
but went silent to the shrine on the mesa where the
Arrow-Stone clan build the signal fire to the mountain
god in the night time. There he said the prayers
which were long prayers, and the people who had
noted him as he passed (nude but for the girdle and
the downy breath feathers of the eagle) halted at their
work among the corn and the melon vines and watched
him at the shrine. From the terraced roofs also the
women turned from their weaving, or the shaping of
pottery, and looked after the tall bronze figure girded,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
and white plumed. They could see his wide-stretched
hands scatter the sacred meal of prayer, and then they
saw only a brown runner on the mesa outlined against
the western sky. He had entered the ceremonial run
in which there is no moment of rest from the mesa of
the river to the mountains of the pine.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE MAID OF DREAMS</h3>
</div>
<p>Indian prayer is not the placid acceptance of
thoughts comforting. The complete man is both
mind and body&ndash;&ndash;and all of him must work
when the gods are called upon for work, and by fasting
and exhaustion must the spirit path be made clear
for dreams.</p>
<p>The first day Tahn-t&eacute; had sat in meditation before
the sacred wall of the stone face, chanting the songs
to the clouds and the yellow birds of the sun color,
watching the pictured rock until the lines moved when
his body swayed to the chant, and a living thing
seemed before him&ndash;&ndash;the accumulated faiths of all
the devotees in that place since the god was born!</p>
<p>As the sun went behind the mountain he knew the
village herald was telling the people, and the leaders
of Povi-whah would fast that night and send their
thoughts to him. Po-tzah would fast although Po-tzah
was not called upon by his position to do so.</p>
<p>And Po-tzah had said, &ldquo;Speak for our children to
the god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to hear Po-tzah&rsquo;s voice, and the words
repeat themselves in the dusk, and&ndash;&ndash;stranger still&ndash;&ndash;another
voice back of Po-tzah&rsquo;s! it also spoke of
children&ndash;&ndash;through the chanted prayer he heard it&ndash;&ndash;baffling
yet insistent.</p>
<p>Then he knew it!</p>
<p>He knew it as the first shadow of the visions which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
the prayer was bringing:&ndash;&ndash;it was the voice of the
Ruler whose office he now held&ndash;&ndash;the aged man who
had once worn the white robe and said&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;If she had
not died&ndash;&ndash;her children would be your children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The picture of Po-tzah&rsquo;s small brown babe came
between him and the sacred figure on the rock,&ndash;&ndash;a
strange thing for the voice to suggest! A little child&ndash;&ndash;in
the dusk&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;sheltering arms around it!</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Oh You!<br />
Oh&ndash;&ndash;Indwelling God!<br />
Come to me!<br />
Grey ghost&ndash;&ndash;white ghost<br />
Why is the false enchantment?<br />
Grey ghost of darkness&ndash;&ndash;<br />
White ghost of high hills<br />
Make way for sacred magic,<br />
Sink far your darkened spells!<br />
O You!<br />
O Indwelling God<br />
Come to me!&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>In the dusk a shadow&ndash;&ndash;or it might have been a
drooping bough of the pi&ntilde;on tree&ndash;&ndash;gave outline of a
bent head above the outline of the babe&ndash;&ndash;only a
strange trick of carving on the gray stone, and swaying
branches outlining a head&ndash;&ndash;then the shoulders&ndash;&ndash;then
an arm about the babe! To the mind of the
mystic it was the visible temptation of a black enchantment
in the very presence of the god!&ndash;&ndash;The
strongest the opposing powers could send to man
under vows of prayer and search for the spirit medicine
of the highest thought.</p>

<p>He was no longer merely a singer of prayers now.
The dance before the Ancient gods had begun as the
first stars glimmered in the blue.</p>
<p>After many hours of the dance all the world drifts
far. There is nothing real left but the circle where
the prayer is, and the space where the feet touch in
the dull pad-pad on the trail to the swoons where
visions come.</p>
<p>A lone figure chanting breathless things:&ndash;&ndash;not
aloud now! The utterance is only broken whispers&ndash;&ndash;only
a god could read the meaning of them!</p>
<p>But he did not feel alone. All the Lost Others
were back of him looking on from the dusk of the
pi&ntilde;on boughs, and there to the right, ever in shadow,
was a Presence! It stood close to the rock wall.
The arms were folded, the line of the body strong and
erect. The face was a hidden face, but if he&ndash;&ndash;Tahn-t&eacute;,
faltered in the lines of the prayers,&ndash;&ndash;or
sank in the dance before the time&ndash;&ndash;then he felt that
the phantom there would become real, and the face
would be seen, and that strong Thing would come
forward&ndash;&ndash;it would dance for jealous ghosts the
dance of triumph&ndash;&ndash;it would wipe out in mockery the
unfinished homage to the gods!</p>
<p>The dawn came, and Tahn-t&eacute; danced the stars of
morning into the glow of the sun. The prayers had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
been all said, and the Watcher no longer stood by the
rock!</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; saw nothing now but the glare of the sun
on the rock wall&ndash;&ndash;a spot of light in the circle of
black pi&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>He no longer even whispered. His moving arms
seemed no longer a part of him&ndash;&ndash;it was as if numbness
was there. His feet moved mechanically&ndash;&ndash;not
able to lift themselves more quickly&ndash;&ndash;neither able to
cease by his own will.</p>
<p>The Trues were watching him now, waiting to help.
There was the white bear of the North and the mountain
lion of the East. There was the wildcat of the
West, and the serpent of the South. There was the
eagle of the upper world, and the mystic creature of
the earth home which tells the weather wizards of the
number of winter days.</p>
<p>They were all there&ndash;&ndash;so the prayer had been a
good prayer.</p>
<p>From some of them would come the medicine
dreams!</p>
<p>The sun stood straight above,&ndash;&ndash;then little by little
reached towards the mountain. It made shadows,
and as the shadow of the sacred rock touched the
blinded dancer, he sank to the earth.</p>
<p>As he fell he strove to echo the prayer thought:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;I find the light<br />
I&ndash;&ndash;master of spells!&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>But he did not speak it. Only the eagle of his
dream repeated it over and over as it lifted him from
the place where he had fallen, and bore him swiftly
to the highest point of the mountain of Tse-c[=o]me-u-pi&ntilde;.
It has been the Sacred Mountain since men first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
spoke words in the land. When a man has climbed
to the shrine of the summit there, it is as if all the
world is very far below.</p>
<p>And that makes it lonely for the dweller there.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The stars were again alight in the heavens when
the devotee awoke from his sleep of exhaustion. To
his entranced senses the stars were as the eyes of the
gods who watched the shrine where few men had ever
danced and lived. The wind touched the pines&ndash;&ndash;and
he thought their whispered movement was the
rustle of the wings of the eagle who had come in his
vision.</p>
<p>For the eagle was now his medicine, and the place
where the eagle had carried him in the dream was the
best of all good places for medicine that was strong.</p>
<p>In the starlight he again faced the ancient diety of
the Lost Others:&ndash;&ndash;those Others who had carved
the stone lions of Kat-yi-ti at their entrance to the
Under world, and had set the white stone bear of the
North on guard in the western hills. They did fine
things&ndash;&ndash;those people who had perhaps first named
the stars above. And this one ancient cave god of
the stone face was a link&ndash;&ndash;so the wise old Ruler had
told him&ndash;&ndash;with strange Mexic Brothers of the far
south&ndash;&ndash;who gave worship&ndash;&ndash;and gave human sacrifice,
to a solitary mountain shrine, called the shrine
of the Sleeping Woman, where few men could dance&ndash;&ndash;or
even learn the prayers of that dance.</p>
<p>No awesome Presence now faced him in the shadow
of the rock as he chanted his prayer of farewell under
the stars. He had danced all adverse spirits out of
the charm&eacute;d circle. His way was clearly marked
now to follow the way of the eagle,&ndash;&ndash;there on the
shrine of Tse-c[=o]me-u-pi&ntilde; he must say the final prayer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
All of harmony and all of hope was about him.
Three days and three nights had he ran or chanted
prayers, or danced fasting, yet weariness was not with
him as he ended the ceremony which no man since his
birth had made in this place.</p>
<p>Somewhere, he would perhaps fall on the trail, and
the men of Kah-po or of Povi-whah would find him,
as fainting medicine men had been found ere this&ndash;&ndash;but
that must be after he had reached the shrine, and
gave prayers at the place of the eagle dream.</p>
<p>Past Pu-y&eacute; he went&ndash;&ndash;scarce seeing the ghost walls
of the older day; in sight of Shufinne, the little island
of forgotten dwellings on the north mesa&ndash;&ndash;through
the pines to the ca&ntilde;on of Po-et-se where rocks of
weird shapes stood like gray and white giants to bar
his way. He thought at times voices sounded from
the stone pillars, but it might be the echo of his own.&ndash;&ndash;He
knew evil spirits did lurk along his trail&ndash;&ndash;no
mortal could escape their shadows. Even the god
who had lived in the sun had been hurled to earth by
them when the earth was new, and the first trees&ndash;&ndash;the
pines, had begun to grow at the edges of the ice.
Since that time the Sun God only lived in the sky one
half the time. In the night he went to the Underworld,
and the strands of his dark hair covered his
face. He must not let himself think that the adverse
spirits were less than men in strength&ndash;&ndash;for man
needed all the medicine of the gods to war against
evil!</p>
<p>Thus he thought&ndash;&ndash;and muttered and stumbled
blindly towards the north. Into the stream of Po-eh-hin-cha
he crept and drank,&ndash;&ndash;then up&ndash;&ndash;up to
Po-pe-kan-eh&ndash;&ndash;the Place where the Water is Born,
and from there to the shrine of the Sacred Mountain,
though his hands reached for help from every tree and
rock past which he staggered or crept.</p>

<p>Only water and the smoke of the medicine pipe had
been his portion. One may not eat the food of man,
yet commune with Those Above.</p>
<p>The first stars were above the hills as he fell, bleeding
from many hurts&ndash;&ndash;and breathless&ndash;&ndash;at the
shrine.</p>
<p>Far above one lone eagle soared, and the weariness
was forgotten in the joy of Tahn-t&eacute;. The sacred
spark came quickly to the twigs crossed ceremonially
for the fire on the shrine, and into the blue above, the
slender trail of smoke led undeviatingly up where the
great bird drifted as if awaiting to witness his offering
of fire. Had any other found medicine like that?
He knew now that his magic was to be strong magic,
for his faith had been great&ndash;&ndash;and he had followed
the faith, and found the bird of the strong gods waiting
his coming!</p>
<p>Time was lost to him in the trance of that which
he had lived through. The day was gone, and he
stood alone on the heights and reached his hands in
ecstasy to his brothers the stars. He felt the exultant
strength of the mortal with whom the gods have
worked!</p>
<p>And when the last mountain prayer had been
whispered, a reeling, staggering, nude figure walked,
and sometimes ran and often fell down the steep
sides of Tse-c[=o]me-u-pi&ntilde;, and when the great dark
pines and the slender aspens were reached, he used his
hands as well as his feet in making his way, reeling
from tree to tree, but holding with instinctive steadiness
to the trail of the Navahu&ndash;&ndash;the ancient way of
the enemy, where ambush and slaughter was often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
known. Many captives had been driven between the
high rock walls. Youths and maidens swept from
Te-hua corn fields, and Navahu captives as well,
caught by Te-hua hunters in the hunting grounds to
the West,&ndash;&ndash;all came through the one great pass&ndash;&ndash;and
the way of the trail was so narrow that to guard
it was not a hard thing in time of battle.</p>
<p>The rush of the swift water was always near as he
went on and on in the darkness. It had a lulling
effect. The whispers of the pines also spoke of rest.
This was the fourth day of the fasting. He, Tahn-t&eacute;,
had been strong as few men are strong, but suddenly
in the night, earth and sky seemed to meet, and putting
out his hands he groped through a thicket of the
young pines, and fell there quite close to the dancing
water&ndash;&ndash;and all the life of earth drifted far. He,
Tahn-t&eacute;, the devotee of the Trues&ndash;&ndash;the weaver of
spells, and dancer of the Ancient Dance to the God
of the Stone, lay at last in the stupor beyond dreams,
helpless in the path of an enemy if any should trail
him for battle.</p>
<p>His sleep was dreamless, and the length of it until
the dawn seemed but a hand&rsquo;s breadth on the path of
the stars across the sky.</p>
<p>But with the dawn a vision came, and he knew it
again as the actual form of that which had been so
often the vague dream-maid of charm&eacute;d moments.</p>
<p>There was the flash of water in the pool&ndash;&ndash;a something
distinct from the steady murmur of its ripples&ndash;&ndash;that
was the sign by which he was wakened quite
suddenly, without movement or even a breath that
was loud. Under the little pines at the very edge of
the stream he was veiled in still green shadows, and
there before him was The Maid of Dreams. Those
Above had let her come to him that for once his eyes
should see and his heart keep her in the medicine
visions of this fasting time of prayer.</p>

<p>Not once did she turn her eyes towards him as she
stood, dripping with the water of the bath. Her
slender figure was in shadow, and her movements
were shy and alert and quick.</p>
<p>To the dry sand she stepped, and lifted thence a
white deerskin robe. Two bluebird wings were in
the white banda about her loosened hair, very blue
was the color of the wings as the light touched them,
and he thought of the wonderful Navahu Goddess
Estsan-atlehi who was created from an earth jewel&ndash;&ndash;the
turquoise, and who is the belov&eacute;d of the Sun. If
a maid could be moulded from any jewel of earth,
Tahn-t&eacute; thought she would look like this spirit of the
forest stream. Even while held by the wonder and
the beauty of the vision, he thought of this, and recalled
the bluebird feathers in the prayer plumes of
Tusayan:&ndash;&ndash;next to the eagle they were sacred
feathers:&ndash;&ndash;the gods were sending him strong
thoughts for magic!</p>
<p>Suddenly the maid stood tense and erect as though
listening&ndash;&ndash;or was it only the nearness of a mortal by
which she was thrilled to movement?&ndash;&ndash;for she
clasped the trailing white skin to her breast, and
stepped into the deeper shadow where grew the fragrant
thickets of the young pine under the arms of the
great pine mothers.</p>
<p>Without sound she moved. His eyes watched in
strained eagerness for the one turn of the head, or
one look of the eyes towards him, but that was not to
be. To mortal all the joys cannot be given at one
time&ndash;&ndash;else all would be as gods!</p>
<p>He stared at the shadows into which she had
blended herself, and he stared at the pool from which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
she had arisen. It was again a mirror reflecting only
the coming day. Yet his heart leaped as he saw a
sign left there for him!</p>
<p>Drifting idly there in a circle was a bit of blue too
vivid for the echo of the sky of dawn&ndash;&ndash;it was the
wing of a bluebird, and even as he looked, it was
caught in an eddy more swift, and moved on the surface
of the water straight to the edge of the bank
nearest his place of rest.</p>
<p>Staggering to his feet, he went to meet it. It was
not an empty vision as the maid had been, and it did
not fade as he grasped it. The visions of the night
had been strong visions, but with the dawn had come
to Tahn-t&eacute; the added medicine of the second gift of
the Spirits of the Air. Above the clouds must his
thoughts be in their height. The medicine of the
eagle had made that plain to him, and the feathers of
prayer lay in his hand as a sign such as had come to
no other man!</p>
<p>The Brothers of the Air were plainly to be his
kindred!</p>
<p>This was the dawning of the fifth day on the prayer
trail. A little way he walked, and the world reeled
about him,&ndash;&ndash;to escape from the cloud of weakness
he ran the way of the brook towards the far river&ndash;&ndash;and
then as a brook falls into the shadows of a cavern
place, Tahn-t&eacute; fell and lay where he fell. In the
darkness closing over him he heard the rustle of wings&ndash;&ndash;though
another might have heard only the whisper
of the pines.</p>
<p>When the sun stood straight above, and the bush
of the sage brooded over its own shadow, it was then
Po-tzah and the brothers of Po-tzah found him.
They wondered at the wing of the bluebird in his
hand, but carried him on a robe of the buffalo until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
they brought him to his own home. Then the people
of his order brought to him the foods and the drinks
allowed after the fasting time to the men who make
many prayers.</p>
<p>When the strength had come back he spoke in secret
council of the vision of the eagle and the vision of the
maid born from the waters of the sacred mountain of
prayer.</p>
<p>The old men debated wisely as to the visions and
the meaning of the visions. The dance was a great
dance and plainly had the favor of Sinde-h&eacute;si since
Tahn-t&eacute; had come out of it alive;&ndash;&ndash;the Summer
People would hold a long feast to mark the time, and
the boys who were taught by the old men, would be
told in the kivas of the ways in which a man might
grow strong in body and strong in spirit to face the
god who lives on high in the hills.</p>
<p>Of the visions of the eagles they were glad&ndash;&ndash;for
in his dream Tahn-t&eacute; had been carried by the eagle to
the shrine of power, and that was very great medicine.
It was well he had kept strength to follow the trail
and meet the eagle there.</p>
<p>Of the maid-vision there was long talk. To dream
of a maid was the natural dream thought of a young
man, and the wing of the bird could be only the
symbol for thoughts that fly very high.</p>
<p>The clan of his mother&ndash;&ndash;the Arrow Stone People,
thought the vision by the pool meant that the time to
choose a wife had come to Tahn-t&eacute;. He had proven
himself for magic. It was now time that he think of
strong sons.</p>
<p>The elders agreed that it was so, and talked of likely
maids, and that was when the name of Yahn the
Beautiful was spoken. But Tahn-t&eacute; heard part of the
talk, and stopped it. He had read the books of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
white god, and out of them all he had found one
strong thought. The white god, and the prophets
of that god, were strong for magic because they did
not take wives of the tribes about them. Because of
that they had been strong to conquer their world.
He, Tahn-t&eacute;, meant to work for the red gods as the
priests of the dark robe worked for the white gods.
He would work alone unless other men worked with
him. It was not magic in which a woman could help.
But alone he fastened four feathers of a bluebird to
the Prayer Flute of the far desert, and in the dusks
under Venus and the young moon he breathed
through it softly to bring back the vision of the
Maid of Dreams.</p>
<p>Not all this talk was spoken of outside the kiva:&ndash;&ndash;only
the name of Yahn had been said&ndash;&ndash;and that
Tahn-t&eacute; would have no wife even when urged by the
old men. But Koh-p&eacute;, the wife of Ka-yemo did hear
of it&ndash;&ndash;also some other wives, and Yahn Tsyn-deh
heard their laughter, and carried a bitter heart in the
days to follow. She had no love for Tahn-t&eacute;, yet&ndash;&ndash;to
wed with the Highest&ndash;&ndash;would be victory over a
false lover!</p>
<p>For the feast made for Tahn-t&eacute; the Po-Ahtun-ho,
she would gather no flowers and bake no bread, and
when the dance in honor of Tahn-t&eacute; was danced, she
put on her dress of a savage, brown deer skin fringed
and trimmed with tails of the ermine of the north.
About her brows she fastened a band on which were
white shells and many beads in the pattern of the
lightening path&ndash;&ndash;and on it was also the white of
the ermine&ndash;&ndash;and the warrior feathers of the eagle
which she wore not often&ndash;&ndash;but this day she wore
them!</p>

<p>Also she took from an earthen jar the strands of
beads of the Navahu. With head held high she
walked through the village and knew well that she
looked finer than all the dancers. Thus proudly she
walked to the sands by the river&rsquo;s edge, and held the
beads against her brow and bosom&ndash;&ndash;and twisted
them about her round arms as she gazed at her reflection
in the water. But the pride and the defiance
died out of her face when there were no jealous eyes
to watch, and a tear fell on the still water, breaking
the picture.</p>
<p>For a space she stood&ndash;&ndash;a lonely figure despite her
trophies&ndash;&ndash;and the music of the dance came to her
on the wind, and filled her with sullen rage. A canoe
was on the shore above; she pushed it into the water
and stepped in lifting the paddle of split ash wood
and sending the craft darting downwards&ndash;&ndash;anywhere
to be away from the voices of people.</p>
<p>And Koh-p&eacute;, of the red beads, laughed at a safe
distance, and told her comrades of the terraces that
the Apache had gone fishing without a net&ndash;&ndash;she
would come home empty!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>COMING OF THE CASTILIANS</h3>
</div>
<p>Because a runner from Kat-yi-ti had been
killed on the trail by a mountain lion, and because
the village of Povi-whah had forgotten
the strangers from the south in the excitement of
Tahn-t&eacute;&rsquo;s return (for many there were who thought
never to see him again!)&ndash;&ndash;because of these things it
was that the men of iron rode unseen by the river, and
the alarm was called from sentry to sentry on the mesa
where the workers in flint shaped the arrow-points,
and were guards as well for the village below.</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the glint of sunlight on
steel and helmet, and the beasts with strange strappings.
The men of the beards were indeed at the
very edge of their planted fields!</p>
<p>And they saw more than that, for they saw a girl
who ran from the shore to meet them. So fleet was
her running that her hair swept like a dusk cloud behind
her, and the soldier Gonzalvo stared at her with
open mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the true cross, that looks better to me than
the thimble full of gold!&rdquo; he announced, and Don
Ruy laughed and put his horse on the other side of
Don Diego as though to protect him from temptation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, and his reverence the padre, have the
records and the prayers to your share,&rdquo; he suggested,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but
eyes bright as those&ndash;&ndash;and lips as tempting&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The heathen wench does look like the seven
deadly sins for enticement,&rdquo; agreed Don Diego and
made the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shameless wench, indeed,&rdquo; agreed Padre Vicente&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;with
her bosom bare, and little but her hair
as a cloak!&ndash;&ndash;What is it she calls?&ndash;&ndash;Holy God!&ndash;&ndash;did
you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All had halted now. Pretty women and girls had
been hidden in the villages of their trail. Even if
they chanced to glimpse one it was by chance&ndash;&ndash;and
among the wall-housed barbarians no dames bold as
this one had been seen:&ndash;&ndash;neither had one been seen
so alluring.</p>
<p>Again her voice reached them and this time the
tones were clear and the words certain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greetings to you&ndash;&ndash;Lords&ndash;&ndash;Castilians!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shout went up from the men. At last a land had
been reached where an interpreter was not needed for
the woman. It put a different complexion on the
day. Tired men straightened in their saddles and
Ruy Sandoval laughed at the amaze on the face of
Gonzalvo&ndash;&ndash;that hardy soldier of many lands stared
as if by a witch enthralled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How call you yourself, mistress?&rdquo; inquired the
priest coldly, &ldquo;and is it the custom of the men of the
P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute; to send their wives to greet men who
travel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yahn Tsyn-deh I am,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she said&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and not
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; the grunt of Maestro Diego was not
polite. Even the desert might not be a safe place
to bring youth if damsels of this like grew in the
sage clumps. &ldquo;It is said to be a good luck sign
when a man comes first over the threshold on a New
Year&rsquo;s day and on a Monday,&ndash;&ndash;it starts the year and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
the week aright&ndash;&ndash;and how read you this of a female
crossing first for us the line of welcome in the new
land of treasure?&ndash;&ndash;read you good fortune here in
all that would be ill fortune at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save your croaking since she is beautiful to a
marvel!&rdquo; said Don Ruy lightly. &ldquo;If they tell us
truly that the world is round, who knows that we may
not be nicely balanced on an opposite to Seville, and
all things of life and portent to be reversed? There&rsquo;s
a thought for your &lsquo;Relaciones!&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;treasure it, se&ntilde;or!&ndash;&ndash;treasure
it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not yet of a mind that the unsanctified globe
theory is to be accepted by true believers!&rdquo; announced
Don Diego with decision&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;that you well know!&ndash;&ndash;and
also you know that my scriptural evidence&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is as good as that of any man!&rdquo; agreed his
charge who was more his master and tormentor.
&ldquo;But if we halt here while you make the maps of
Cosmo in the sand, we will miss the rest of the maids,
for all my looking shows me no others on the run to
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yahn was, meanwhile, with great unconcern, making
braids of her hair, and breathing with more ease,
and using her eyes well the while. The piercing
look of the padre was the only one she faltered under,
and that of Gonzalvo she met in elusive coquetry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am alone,&rdquo; she said to Don Ruy. &ldquo;The others
feast this day. I know your words. I come alone;
maybe you want that I talk for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true that we all want much talk from you&ndash;&ndash;and
perhaps some smiles&ndash;&ndash;eh? But give not
another to Juan Gonzalvo&ndash;&ndash;he looks like a mooing
calf from the last one he got,&ndash;&ndash;and I warn you that
such special happiness&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; said the padre with impatient authority.
&ldquo;The girl has understanding, and it is best to move
warily when the ground is new. Are you the only
one who speaks Castilian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;two more. Ka-yemo the chief of war&ndash;&ndash;He
is of my clan. He learn it with Capitan
Coronado.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men closed around listening&ndash;&ndash;this was the
man they had heard of at Ah-ko and at Kat-yi-ti.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the shaman who learned with Fray Luis,&rdquo;
said the padre. &ldquo;We have heard of him, and of his
unsanctified devotion to the false gods. We have
come to save such souls for the true faith. And he
is now Capitan&ndash;&ndash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ka-yemo is Capitan&ndash;&ndash;not shaman. He speaks
your words&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other one!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;The face of Yahn darkened,
her lips grew straight in a hard line&ndash;&ndash;her bosom
heaved. Tahn-t&eacute; had seen and known her abasement&ndash;&ndash;also
her name had been among those put aside&ndash;&ndash;always
she would hate Tahn-t&eacute;,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;The other one
is the man of the feast. He has danced where other
men fall dead in the dance. He does not fall dead&ndash;&ndash;not
anything makes him dead! He holds snakes
like other men hold rabbits.&rdquo; (She was watching
warily the faces of her listeners and saw them shrink
in distaste)&ndash;&ndash;her own face grew keen and bright
with cunning. &ldquo;It is true&ndash;&ndash;like this he takes the
snake&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she held a wand of willow about her neck,
and then held it in both hands above her head&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;like
this&ndash;&ndash;and calls it &lsquo;brother of the sands.&rsquo; He
calls eagles down from the clouds to him&ndash;&ndash;other
birds, too&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and her eyes took on a look of fear&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
in dark nights&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;I can not say more
words! It is bad medicine to say words of witches
while witches are yet alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was taught by the padres to be Christian:&ndash;&ndash;yet
turns back to the false gods, and&ndash;&ndash;is a sorcerer?&rdquo;
demanded Maestro Diego. &ldquo;You have
your work plainly cut out for you, Eminence!&rdquo; and he
turned to Padre Vicente&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;A leader who has been
granted the light, yet seeks darkness, is but a burning
brand for the pit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;suggested the lad Chico&ndash;&ndash;who spoke
but rarely in the face of the company, &ldquo;is there not
white magic as well as the magic of the darkness?
Did not the saints of the church deal openly in the
white magic of their god? This pretty woman
plainly has only hate&ndash;&ndash;or fear&ndash;&ndash;of the sorcerer.
Does the dame strike any of you as being so saintly as
to be above guile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men laughed at that, and Don Ruy clapped
him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well reasoned, Chico&ndash;&ndash;and frankly said! We
will see the sorcerer at his work before we pass
judgement. But the lady will love you little!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The less ill luck to me for that!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;retorted the
lad. &ldquo;Her eyes are all for Juan Gonzalvo&ndash;&ndash;and
for your Excellency!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sworn for my soul&rsquo;s sake to the troth of a
silken scarf and a mad woman somewhere in
Mexico,&rdquo; decided Don Ruy whimsically. &ldquo;If I am
to live a celibate,&ndash;&ndash;as our good padre imposes, it is
well to cheat myself with a lady love across the
border,&ndash;&ndash;even though she gave me no favors beyond
a poet&rsquo;s verse and a battered head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady&ndash;&ndash;beat you?&rdquo; queried Chico in amazement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
looking at the strong figure of Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and
though mad, you give to her&ndash;&ndash;faithfulness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A faithfulness enforced, lad!&rdquo; and his patron
chuckled at the amaze in the eyes of the youth.
&ldquo;Since this crusade allows us no dames for company
it is an ill one among us cannot cheat himself into the
thought that a gracious do&ntilde;a awaits his return! It
is the only protection against such sirens as this one
of the loosened braids. To be sure, my goddess of
Mexico&ndash;&ndash;(so says the padre)&ndash;&ndash;was only a mad
woman&ndash;&ndash;and her servants gave me a scratched
skull. Yet, as I am weak and need protection, I
carry the scarf of the wench, and call her a goddess
and my &lsquo;Do&ntilde;a Bradamante&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;in my dreams&ndash;&ndash;that
does no harm to any one, and enables me to
leave the ladies of the road to Gonzalvo&ndash;&ndash;and the
others! Oh&ndash;&ndash;a dream woman is a great rest to the
mind, lad,&ndash;&ndash;especially is she so when she affects a
wondrous perfume for her silks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew the scarf from his pocket and sniffed at
it, content to make the lad laugh at the idle fancy,
and while he jested thus, Padre Vicente and Gonzalvo
gathered much information from Yahn
Tsyn-deh. There was a feast, she told them, and all
the village was merry, and the time of the visit was
a good time.</p>
<p>From the terraces of Kah-po and Povi-whah many
eyes watched the coming of the men of iron. But
the women who watched were few,&ndash;&ndash;all the maids
and even the young wives, had started at once for
the sanctuary of the ancient dwellings of the place
of Old Fields. There the Woman of the Twilight
was awaiting them&ndash;&ndash;much corn and dried meat and
beans had been stored there in the hills in waiting for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
this time. If fighting was to be done, it should not
be a quarrel for wives&ndash;&ndash;as had happened with
Coronado&rsquo;s soldiers in Tiguex.</p>
<p>But the white adventurers gave every evidence of
the desire to be modest in their demands. They did
not even enter the village&ndash;&ndash;nor seek to do so until
the place of the camp had been decided upon. Even
Jos&eacute; was not allowed to precede the others in search
of kindred. He and his wife Ysobel watched the
terraces, and the courage of the latter grew weak
unto tears at the trials possibly behind the silent walls.</p>
<p>The boy Chico reassured her with jestings and
occasional whisperings until the woman smiled,
though her eyes were wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall risk my own precious soul and body beside
you,&rdquo; he stated,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;since my master Don Diego
makes me a proxy while we learn if it is safe enough
inside those walls for his own sacred bones. He will
say the prayers for us until our faces are shown to
him again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he threw himself on the green sward and
laughed, and told Ysobel what a fine thing it was to
be carefree of a spouse and able to kick up one&rsquo;s heels:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;If
it had not been for love and a wedding day
you would be happily planting beans in the garden
of the nuns instead of following a foreign husband to
his own people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ruy sauntered near enough to hear the fillip
and see the woman dry her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it, Dame Ysobel, that you allow this lad
to make sport of serious things?&rdquo; he asked austerely.
&ldquo;He is woefully light minded for so portentous an
expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ysobel stammered, and glanced at the lad, and dug
her toe in the soil, and was dumb.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You overwhelm her with your high and mighty
notice, Excellency,&rdquo; said the lad coming to her aid.
&ldquo;I will tell you truly&ndash;&ndash;Ysobel has had patience with
me since I had the height of your knee&ndash;&ndash;and it is
now a custom with her. She lived once in the house
of my&ndash;&ndash;relatives. We were both younger&ndash;&ndash;and
she had no dreams of wedding a wild Indian&ndash;&ndash;nor
I of seeking adventure among savages. She is
afraid now that her husband may be blamed&ndash;&ndash;or
sacrificed for bringing strangers here&ndash;&ndash;the story of
the padre at the well of Ah-ko is not forgotten by
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Don Ruy told her there should be no
harm to Jos&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;if he was treated without welcome
by the Te-huas he should go back in safety to Mexico
to follow his own will in freedom.</p>
<p>The woman murmured thanks and was content,
and his excellency surveyed the secretary in silence
a bit, until warm color crept into the face of the boy
to his own confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&ndash;&ndash;Your independence was because you had
a friend at court?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he observed. &ldquo;It is fool luck
that you, with your girl&rsquo;s mouth, and velvet cheeks,
should get nearest the only woman in camp&ndash;&ndash;and
have a secret with her! It is high time you went to
confession!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon which he walked away, and left the two together,
and Chico lay on the grass and laughed until
called to make records of all that might occur between
visiting Castilian and the Children of the Sun
in their terraced village.</p>
<p>Then, while the men set about the preparations for
a resting place, and supper Padre Vicente, with Don
Ruy, Chico, Gonzalvo and the two Indians walked
quietly to the gate in the great wall.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>Many eyes were watching them as they were well
aware, and ere they reached the gate, it opened, and
the old governor Phen-tza, the war capitan and several
of the older men stood there with courteous
greeting of hand clasps and invitation.</p>
<p>For the first time since his marriage, Ka-yemo
came face to face with Yahn Tsyn-deh, and quick
anger flamed in his eyes as he saw her walk close to
the side of Juan Gonzalvo who whispered to her&ndash;&ndash;and
her answer was a smile from provocative, half
closed eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yahn!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the voice of Ka-yemo was not loud,
but hard and full of angry meaning. &ldquo;The other
women of your clan have gone to the hills!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them go,&rdquo; said the girl insolently&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I do
not go! For these strangers I make the talks to the
old men, I am the one woman needful in the valley
of P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the hour of her triumph, and Padre Vicente
looked at the two keenly. Here was a clash of two
savage minds&ndash;&ndash;potent for good or ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the council I will talk&ndash;&ndash;I am of the people
of your father&ndash;&ndash;I am the nearest man&ndash;&ndash;I tell you
I forbid you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words fell over each other in anger, and his
uncle, the governor, looked at him in reproach&ndash;&ndash;this
was not a moment for private quarrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you so!&ndash;&ndash;the nearest?&rdquo; and Yahn showed
her teeth. &ldquo;I do not see it so. I stand near two
other men, and am well content!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood between Gonzalvo and Chico, and
smiled on the latter, who frankly smiled a response&ndash;&ndash;at
that moment Yahn was happy in her defiance.
Ka-yemo need not think her forsaken! She had
caught fish without a net! To the governor Jos&eacute;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
was speaking; at once there were signs of delight
among the listeners. One of the old men was of
his clan&ndash;&ndash;other of his people were alive&ndash;&ndash;and all
had thought never to look on him again, it was a
good day at Povi-whah!</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; showed them his wife, who was greeted with
joy, and all proceeded to the court of the village,
where, at the house of the governor, they were given
cooked corn of the feast, then rolls of bread, and
stew of deer meat.</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; told of his days as a slave until he was traded
into the land of Padre Vicente, and of the great desire
of Padre Vicente to bring him back in some
lucky year to his people, and also to see with his own
eyes the fine land of the Te-huas. He added also
that the padre had been very kind, and that he was
near to the white god of the men of iron, and strong
in medicine of the spirit world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We already know that the medicine of the men
of iron is strong medicine&ndash;&ndash;and that their gods
listen,&rdquo; said the governor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also Tahn-t&eacute; the Po-Ahtun-ho makes it seen
that the mountain god of this land, and the young
god of the Castilian land, were maybe brothers,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;said
Po-tzah watching closely the faces of the
strangers. &ldquo;Only your god made talking leaves&ndash;&ndash;and
our god gave us only the sunshine to see things
for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is this man who tells you that books are
made and that false gods are brothers to the true?&rdquo;
inquired Padre Vicente.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Po-Ahtun-ho,&rdquo; said Jos&eacute; before Yahn
could speak. &ldquo;In Castilian he would be called
Cacique. The word in Maya for that ruler is the
same word as in Te-hua. It is a very old word. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
is the head of the highest order of the Spirit Things.
It is what you call maybe Pope. There are many
priests, and many medicine men in each village.
There is only one Cacique at one time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of these men may it be?&rdquo; inquired Padre
Vicente. Yahn it was who answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cacique of Povi-whah is not seen by every
stranger who walks by the river,&rdquo; she said, and
smiled scornfully. &ldquo;He has come out of the mountain
from the dance to the greatest of gods, and after
that dance it is not easy to talk to earth people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;when people come from the far lands of
a strange king&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the business of the governor and of the
war capitan,&rdquo; stated Yahn. &ldquo;He who is named
Cacique in this land has not to do with strangers in
the valley. His mind is with the Spirit Things.
These are the heads of the village of Povi-whah&ndash;&ndash;here
also is the governor of Kah-po. They will listen,
and learn from your words, and answer you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know words,&rdquo; stated Ka-yemo looking at Don
Ruy and the priest. &ldquo;I can say words&ndash;&ndash;I teach it
her,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and he motioned to Yahn, who had dwarfed
them all with quick wit and glib speech. &ldquo;Woman
not need in council. I&ndash;&ndash;captain of war can make
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is not the damsel enlisted as official interpreter
for one of us?&rdquo; queried Don Ruy. &ldquo;I hold it best
that the bond be understood lest the beauty be sent
beyond reach&ndash;&ndash;and some of our best men squander
time on her trail! Since you, good father, have
Jos&eacute;,&ndash;&ndash;I will lay claim to this Cleopatra who calls
herself by another name,&ndash;&ndash;a fire brand should be
kept within vision. Your pardon, Eminence&ndash;&ndash;and
you to the head of the council in all else!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></div>
<p>The padre directed his conversation to Ka-yemo,
while the secretary set down the claiming of Yahn
as the first official act in council of His Excellency
Don Ruy de Sandoval.</p>
<p>At the scratching of the quill, his excellency looked
over the shoulder of the lad, and read the words,
and smiled with his eyes, while his lips muttered dire
threats&ndash;&ndash;even to discharging him from office if the
records were kept in a manner detrimental.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Detrimental to whom, my lord?&rdquo; asked the lad,
who saw well the restrained smile. &ldquo;Your &lsquo;Do&ntilde;a
Bradamante&rsquo; of the scarf is not to set eyes on these
serious pages,&ndash;&ndash;and the Don Diego will certainly
exact that I keep record of how near our company
falls in the wake of the Capitan Coronado&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;their
troubles began about a wife&ndash;&ndash;thus it is well to keep
count of fair favorites&ndash;&ndash;and this one who tells you
plainly she is no wife, looks promising. Helena of
Trois might have had no more charms to her discredit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ruy said no more, for he saw that Yahn was
straining her ears to catch at their meaning, and they
were all losing the words of council. It appeared
plain that all the chief men were quite willing that
the Po-Ahtun-ho should meet the men of iron as was
the padre&rsquo;s wish&ndash;&ndash;but that no one could command
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through what power is one man more supreme
than others?&ndash;&ndash;Yet you say you have no
king!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;no king. The Governor is made so each
year by the men in council&ndash;&ndash;only one year&ndash;&ndash;then
another man&ndash;&ndash;the Governor gets no corn in trade
for his time,&ndash;&ndash;and no other thing, but honor, if he
is good! Tahn-t&eacute; has talked to us in council of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
kings,&ndash;&ndash;thus we know what a king does. We have
no king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But while a man is the governor does he not rule
all the people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;it is not so. He works for the people.
He has a right hand man, and a left hand man to
talk with of all things. But when it is a big thing
of trouble or of need, at that time the council is
called, and each man speaks, and in the end each man
put a black bean or a white bean in a jar to say for
him &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or to say for him &lsquo;no.&rsquo; That is how
the law is made in all the villages of the P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute;
valley. There is no king!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are of a surety in a new world if rulers work
only for honor&ndash;&ndash;and get not any of that unless
they are good!&rdquo; decided Don Ruy. &ldquo;Make record
of that novelty, Chico&ndash;&ndash;our worthy Maestro Diego
will find no equal of that rule in all Europe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well for civilization that it is so!&rdquo; decided
Juan Gonzalvo. &ldquo;Who is to advance the arts and
knightly orders except there be Courts of Pontiff
and of Royalty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the royalty would be a weak stomached lot
if they gained not even extra corn for all their sceptre
waving, and royal nods;&ndash;&ndash;eh? But what of this
Po-Ahtun-ho&ndash;&ndash;this man who is not king&ndash;&ndash;yet who
is supreme?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This query was interpreted by Jos&eacute;, and after
talk and deliberation one of the oldest men made
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Po-Ahtun is an order very ancient. When
the earth was yet soft, and the rocks wet, and the
first people were taught words by the mocking bird,&ndash;&ndash;in
that time of our Ancient Fathers, gods spoke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
to men&ndash;&ndash;and in that time the order of Po-Ahtun was
made. It was made that men could work together
on earth for spirit good. When the Mountain God,
Po-se-yemo, lived as a man on the earth,&ndash;&ndash;he was the
chief priest of the Po-Ahtun order. Po-Ahtun means
&lsquo;The Ruler of Things from the Beginning.&rsquo; Many
men belong to the Po-Ahtun, and learn the prayers,
and the songs of the prayers. When the Po-Ahtun-ho
walks no more on the earth&ndash;&ndash;and his spirit goes
on the twilight trail to Those Above, at that time the
brothers of the order name the man who is to be
Ruler&ndash;&ndash;and he rules also until he dies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it seems your Cacique is really a king.
You but call him by a different name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;it is not so. Tahn-t&eacute; has told the men
of Povi-whah what a king is. We have no king.
A king fights with knife, and with spear, and he, in
his own village, punishes the one who does evil, and
orders what men work on the water canal for the
fields:&ndash;&ndash;and what men make new a broken wall, or
what men clean the court which is the property of
all. The king and his men say how all these things
then must be done. With the people of Povi-whah
the governor does these works and orders them done,
and has the man whipped if the work he does is bad
work. The chief of war does work as do other
men, until the Navahu and the Yutahs have to be
driven away;&ndash;&ndash;then it is his work to fight them&ndash;&ndash;he
is a warrior, but he does king work in war. These
are the men who do king work. But we have no
king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By our Lady!&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;tis a nice distinction,&rdquo; said
Don Ruy as the old man ceased, and the men of Te-hua
nodded their appreciation of the old man&rsquo;s statement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
&ldquo;Save your quill scratching, Chico&ndash;&ndash;until
you are in camp. Their eyes show little favor for
the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary obediently thrust in his pouch ink
horn and quill, and clearly Don Ruy was right, for
the bronze faces brightened, and their eyes regarded
the young man with approval&ndash;&ndash;the magic of that
black water might prove potent and forbidding&ndash;&ndash;never
before had it been seen in council.</p>
<p>Padre Vicente had given a cigarro to each man,
and while the ancient speaker rested, and Jos&eacute; interpreted,
all smoked the wonderful smoke from the
south, and Chico took occasion to say low to Don
Ruy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all this there is little to make record that is
new. Tribes of Mexico have such rules of life.
The legends of our people say they came ages ago
out of the far North. These are maybe but the
children of their brothers who the records say stopped
on the way to plant corn, or to hunt, or to rest from
travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Records?&ndash;&ndash;Where are such records?&rdquo; asked
Don Ruy derisively,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;in the royal archives of some
mud hut?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of Chico flashed fire for one instant; the
amazed Spaniard was scarce certain of the anger in
the secretary&rsquo;s face when it changed, and the boy
shrugged his shoulders and lit a cigarro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, Excellency, that if any Tescucan manuscripts
are yet entire, it can be only because some
pagan Indian his risked death and torture to hide
them in mud hut or cave in the hills. The first holy
archbishop of Mexico made bonfires of Indian books
because the beauty of them showed plainly they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
the work of Satan. Without doubt the act earned
the bishop an extra jewel for his heavenly crown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chico! If you pursue such fancies with determination
you may end by being a logician and going
to hell!&rdquo; remarked Don Ruy. &ldquo;I fear you lack a
true Christian spirit, my son. But the records?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only stone carved ones are still visible in the
land of Anhuac,&rdquo; returned the boy. &ldquo;The good
padres say that they deal with the studies of the stars
and planets, and other such speculation invented by
Satanic power. When I wanted to know about them
I was told that my soul was in danger of the pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that frightened you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much, Excellency:&ndash;&ndash;hence my running
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ruy was put to it to know whether or not the
boy spoke truth. But his odd freaks of thought had
many times the effect of an April sunlight on a day
of storm. There was no way of calculating what
the next moment would bring&ndash;&ndash;but the unexpected
was at least a diversion.</p>
<p>The smoking of the men was half over before
Padre Vicente again asked Jos&eacute; to state that the way
of life of the Te-hua people was a thing of interest
to the great king whom the Castilians served, and
it would please him much to hear more of the Te-hua
ruler who was Cacique.</p>
<p>But the old man was silent. He had talked much,
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; said Yahn with quick divination,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;that
he would like to know of the strangers who
are made welcome here:&ndash;&ndash;and why they come far
into a country not their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We come because we have heard fair things of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
these people,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Our god tells us
all men are brothers on the earth&ndash;&ndash;we come to find
new brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if the Navahu come in the night&ndash;&ndash;or the
Yutah come many and strong for the corn&ndash;&ndash;whose
brother would your god tell you to be at that time?&rdquo;
asked the governor of Kah-po, a tall shrewd faced
old man who had not spoken heretofore. Chico
showed his teeth in a quickly suppressed smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our god would tell us,&rdquo; said Padre Vicente with
slowness and duly impressive speech&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;that our
brothers must be the men who are friends with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; agreed the man from Kah-po,
and the others said also it was good. Brothers who
wore iron coats would be good brothers to have in
the time of a war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as Tahn-t&eacute; told us of the priests of the
white god&ndash;&ndash;they are wise in their thoughts,&rdquo; said
the old man who had insisted there was no king in
Povi-whah, or any Te-hua village&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;all Tahn-t&eacute;
has told us were true words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told us also,&rdquo; said the man from Kah-po&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;that
the men of iron were not friends to trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were other men of iron, not these. These
men Tahn-t&eacute; has not yet seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Padre gave no hint that he knew enough of
Te-hua words to catch the meaning of their discourse.
So long as might be, he would keep that secret,&ndash;&ndash;much
might depend upon it.</p>
<p>The name Tahn-t&eacute; met him at every turn&ndash;&ndash;this
was the mysterious Ruler&ndash;&ndash;the hidden Cacique or
Po-Ahtun-ho&ndash;&ndash;the one chief who gave them no
greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask for me what the name means&ndash;&ndash;the name
Tahn-t&eacute;,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>Jos&eacute; pointed to a ray of sunlight streaming
through the shelter of the vine trellis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for what cause is a man called Light of
the Sun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; did not know, but when asked, the ancient
man spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For many reasons, Those Above put the thought
of the Sun in the heart of the mother of Tahn-t&eacute;.
Sunlight he was to Povi-whah&ndash;&ndash;you shall see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little boy was carrying on his head a flat basket
or tray of reeds, and on it were rolls of bread, and
small melons for the feast; at a few words he set
down the tray, and darted around a corner&ndash;&ndash;it was
a day big in history for him. He was doing the
work of his sister who had been sent to the hills&ndash;&ndash;but
for this day the work of a girl was great work&ndash;&ndash;it
took him so close to the men of iron that his hand
could have touched one of them&ndash;&ndash;if his courage
had not failed!</p>
<p>He came back with a jar of shining black pottery,
and placed it beside the old man, who thrust his hand
within and drew out a handful of peaches, dried in
the summer sun of a year before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fruit is gathered with prayer each year from
the first tree planted by the Summer People in this
land,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To Tahn-t&eacute; was given by the gods,
the trees, and the seeds of the trees. Since the time
when Po-se-yemo walked on earth, and brought seeds,
no new seeds have been born from blossoms here in
the land of Te-hua people. When the gods send a
man, they also send a Sign. The sign of Tahn-t&eacute;
was the Flute of the Gods, the trees of this fruit, and
another fruit;&ndash;&ndash;also a grain of which food is made.
It is a good grain. For all of this we make prayers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
each year when the fruit is gathered, and when the
grain is planted, and for all of this we see why the
name of the Sun has been given to Tahn-t&eacute;. The old
men of the Hopi desert say he was born of the falling
rain and the light of the moon. We do not know,
but his mother knew, and she is wise&ndash;&ndash;and she
named him as a child of the Sky would be named.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Castilians listened with little enough belief
in the god-given Cacique. The peaches and the
grain had, without doubt, been brought by Coronado.
Juan Gonzalvo said as much, and Yahn told it
eagerly to the council, but the old men shook their
heads.</p>
<p>The trees were a year old from the seed when
Tahn-t&eacute; carried them on his back from the heart of
the desert, and Capitan Coronado had not yet seen
the villages of the P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute;, called by him the Rio
Grande.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then:&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; said Padre Vicente&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;it is because
he found new seeds that he is above the cares of the
daily life? I can bring many strange seeds from the
gardens of Europe or Africa. For that would I be
a son of the moon and the stars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be so,&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; said the old man,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and maybe
so the gods would not need a son on that day.&rdquo; He
inhaled the fragrant smoke and went on to make
clear to these people of outlands some little gleam of
the mysteries circling holy things,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;You must be
born in a good year&ndash;&ndash;and a good time in that year&ndash;&ndash;the
trail of the visitors of the sky must be climbing
up&ndash;&ndash;up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trail of the visitors in the sky?&rdquo; The
Padre looked with quickness into the bronze faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means the planets&ndash;&ndash;the wandering stars,&rdquo;
said Chico. &ldquo;The Mexican tribes also watch them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
when a child is born. A god lives in each one&ndash;&ndash;so
they think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Necromantic fancies devised by the Evil one!&rdquo;
stated the priest and crossed himself to ostracise such
powers of the demon from the circle. The rest devoutedly
imitated him, and the Te-hua men watched
with interest the men of iron making their &ldquo;medicine&rdquo;
against the celestial bodies on the descending
trail.&ndash;&ndash;That slight automatic gesture in unison
proved even a sort of bond between them and the
dusky old orator;&ndash;&ndash;he could plainly see that the
signs in the heavens were earnestly regarded by the
white strangers. That showed they were wise to
read the true things; for that he could tell them
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maid who was mother to Tahn-t&eacute; is named
The Woman of the Twilight. When little, the
spirit of her broke in two&ndash;&ndash;and she went into the
Land of Twilight. Her parents could not believe
that she would no more walk on the earth. They
went to the Po-Ahtun&ndash;&ndash;they sealed her to that
order&ndash;&ndash;so it was, and the medicine prayer of the
Po-Ahtun brought back the breath to her. But
when a spirit goes to the Land of the Twilight, it
does not come back at once&ndash;&ndash;not all at once! The
gods are strong and can do things. When they
want to take her again and teach her hidden things&ndash;&ndash;they
take her! One Star visitor in the sky took
her when she became woman, and hid her behind all
the hills until her child moved,&ndash;&ndash;then, in the far
desert where the Sun Father is the great god, there
in that place she was laid on the sands beside a well
that the child be earth child like other men. That
is how it was, and she knows why the earth child was
called the child of the Great Star, and of the Sky.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>Yahn listened eagerly&ndash;&ndash;and with sulky frown&ndash;&ndash;Neither
she or Ka-yemo had ever before heard this
account of the Woman of the Twilight and her
son. The magic of it made her feel sullenly helpless.
This then was the reason why no face smiled
in scorn when Tahn-t&eacute; would come sometimes from
mesa, or ca&ntilde;on, bearing his mother in his arms as
one would bear a little child:&ndash;&ndash;all the elders knew
she had been seeking the trail to the Land of Twilight
where long ago she had found a god, and lost
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this woman tells to wise men a fable like
this&ndash;&ndash;and is given their faith?&rdquo; asked Padre
Vicente, while Juan Gonzalvo muttered that the
savages had stolen the truth of the Mother of God,
and should be made pay dear in good time, for the
sacrilege!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mouth of the woman was sealed,&rdquo; stated
the narrator. &ldquo;But the wise men of the desert
sent men to tell the Te-hua people of the magic of
the woman. And the years and the work of her
son made good the stories of the Hopi men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have here no mere juggling pretender,&rdquo; remarked
Padre Vicente&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;a Cacique whose mother
establishes family connection with the stars in the sky,
could in truth have papal power among these heathen!
With all their wise looks, and careful speech, these
old men are not the influence we have to win for
progress in this land:&ndash;&ndash;this man who would place
the false gods above the true God is the man to be
won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or to be conquered!&rdquo; said Juan Gonzalvo
whose wonder was that the priest had patience with
their maudlin tales of village officers, or brats born
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
of magic and the moon,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;If I might speak&ndash;&ndash;Eminence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak&ndash;&ndash;my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These people have sent their women away, and
have told your reverence only of their own things of
pride. Of their real king they give us no sight.
In the New Spain of the South these under-men
would be given few presents of value, and not so
much of your gracious time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke rapidly with a wary eye on the interpreters,&ndash;&ndash;only
Jos&eacute; could follow the swifter speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capitan Gonzalvo gives the word of a soldier,
Padre,&rdquo; remarked Don Ruy, &ldquo;and it may be a true
word. Why not give the gifts, and let us see somewhat
of the feast from which we have won these
dignitaries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Padre Vicente was agreed, and spoke a few words
to Jos&eacute; who departed with his wife for the camp.
The priest gave tobacco, and while the old men
smoked the new medicine, he talked to Ka-yemo of
the one religion, and the one God, and that the great
new god gave the command to his priests to go into
the far lands and carry the light of the faith to his
children who live in darkness.</p>
<p>Ka-yemo interpreted, and the old men nodded
their heads as if to say that was all good&ndash;&ndash;but it
was not told for the first time, and Don Ruy could
have sworn he saw the governor of Kah-po smile
at another man&ndash;&ndash;as one who would question
whether they should be considered as children. Don
Ruy did not know that one man of Kah-po had been
among the two hundred human torches making the
night bright at Tiguex by order of advocates of that
same new and holy god.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>The summers and winters since that time had not
made it all forgotten in the land of the great river.
To the Indian mind in general, it was plain to be
seen that the strong god of the men of iron required
that many victims be made sacrifice at one time. The
gods of the Te-hua people asked but one sacrifice at
one time, and the knife of flint was very sharp, and
found quickly the heart, and the spirit self was sent
quickly and with prayers over the trail of the dusk
to the Light beyond the light.</p>
<p>Ka-yemo alone seemed enchained by the words of
the priest, as he heard again the words and phrases
belonging to that time of which he still dreamed in
the night, and awoke startled and alert.</p>
<p>Yahn watched him with a little frown. She did
not know that the strongest power ever impressed
on his boyish mind, had been the power of the white
conquerors. He had through the years grown away
from its influence, but at sight of the robe, and the
cord, and the shiny black beads, it all came back.
He felt the honor of the fact that the priest of that
strong god was looking at, and talking only to him:&ndash;&ndash;Ka-yemo!</p>
<p>His pride made his eyes kindle and he was very
handsome. Don Ruy wondered why Yahn, his own
official interpreter, looked at him sideways with disapproval.</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; returned with his hands full of the gifts for
which he had been sent. There was one for each
of the men in the group, and the people of the village
pressed close around the door to see them given
away.</p>
<p>Then Padre Vicente stood up and offered to the
governor of Povi-whah a rosary like his own, but of
brown beads.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;They tell me that to you requests are made as
prayers are made, and that from you they are given
again to the Cacique for decision. We present our
request and our gift. Tell him the gift is one kings
have been graciously pleased to wear, and that our
request is that he meet us at an early hour, that we
may speak in kindness of many things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tahn-t&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;you call Cacique&ndash;&ndash;is not yet speaking
with people out of his order,&rdquo; said Phen-tza, the
governor. &ldquo;But this can go, and the message can
go, and on another day Tahn-t&eacute; may ask you to go
in his door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there were clasping of hands, and friendly
smiles and the visitors were free to go or wander
about the village, and watch the greetings of Jos&eacute;
and the comrades of his boyhood. His wife Ysobel
was caressed and admired by the ancient women of
the tribe, and a garland of flowers placed on her
head. At sun rise in the morning she was to present
herself at the door of her new relatives for the baptism
of adoption, and then she would be given also
a Te-hua name.</p>
<p>Padre Vicente and the Castilians were offered an
empty abode outside the wall. Despite the scowls
of the Ka-yemo Yahn delighted to linger close as
might be to Juan Gonzalvo while they all walked to
inspect it. Then the Castilian camp with its wondrous
animals was to be visited by the governor and
other Te-hua men, and great good feeling prevailed.
The wise ecclesiastical head of the cavalcade had
asked nothing but gracious thoughts, and the gifts
he brought had been good gifts.</p>
<p>Don Ruy with the secretary, let who might judge
of the new camp, while he wandered in some surprise
past the door ways decked with feast day garlands&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
above certain ones were pendent bits of turquoise
as if for ceremonial marking of some order or
some clan, and instead of the blanket or arras there
were long reeds strung, and at the end of each string
a beaten twist of copper twinkling like bells when
stirred by any one entering or leaving the dwelling.</p>
<p>The dwelling of the dove cotes had a tiny inside
verandah, and one of the curious robes woven of
twisted rabbit skins was laid over a beam. Great
meal jars stood along the wall, and beside them were
four melons, four full grained heads of the bearded
wheat, also four peaches and four pears. They were
arranged on a great tray of woven reeds, and placed
without the doorway to the right. The careful arrangement
gave all significance of an offering of the
first fruits on an alter. All the other homes had
feasting and laughter and the sound of gaity and
much life; at every other door many smiling faces of
old women and children met them, and the rolls
of feast bread were offered, or bowls of cooked corn.
But here all was silence, only the doves fluttering
above gave life to the place. The reeds at the entrance
hung straight and still. This entrance faced
the south, but there was another towards the east
and the river. The mysterious island of stone
called the Mesa of the Hearts, loomed dark across the
water and a beaten path led from that east door to
the water&rsquo;s edge. Don Ruy could see from the bank
that a canoe was there made from a log hollowed by
careful burnings.</p>
<p>The silent corner where the doves fluttered, held
his attention and he returned to it. Chico it was
who stepped close to the rabbit skin robe, and saw
beside the melons, the ears of wheat, and the yet
green, unripe fruit of the pears and the peaches.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>The dried peaches in the jar shown them by the old
Te-hua man had not given either of them a second
thought, but the two fruits grown from trees, and
the bearded wheat of the Mediterranean arranged in
the basket with the care given a sacred offering, was
a different matter. Don Ruy noted the staring eyes
and parted lips of the boy, and silently stepped nearer
at a gesture.</p>
<p>Then they stared in each others eyes as men who
look on death unexpected, or witchcraft&ndash;&ndash;or some
of the experiences of this life for which there are
no words, and Don Ruy laid his hand on the shoulder
of the lad, and drew him in silence out of the
shadow of the roofed entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good to be where the bright sun shows things
as they are,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;The shadows and silence
of that place tied the tongue. How feel you now,
Lad, as to the story of Don Teo the Greek and the
seeds that were given to the maid as sacred medicine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;the man died&ndash;&ndash;so says the padre&ndash;&ndash;and
the woman&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they fell silent and each was thinking back
over the trails of the desert, and their company of
thirty men&ndash;&ndash;and the care needed to find the way
alive with all the help of provisions and of beasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman had a greater journey and a more
troublous one,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;said Don Ruy. &ldquo;These are
clearly the fruits of Spanish gardens, but in some
other way have they reached this land. It was made
plain that the place of the palms where he left her
was unknown leagues towards the western sea, and
that the maid could only die in the desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He crossed this river in his travels before he
saw the Indian maid of medicine charms,&rdquo; reminded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
the secretary. &ldquo;Do you not recall the journeys with
the war people? He may have bestowed upon
others the seeds of other lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ruy drew a long breath, and then laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By our Lady!&ndash;&ndash;You bring joy with that
thought!&rdquo; he said heartily.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I made sure the
Devil was alive and was working ahead on our trail
when my eyes were startled by the offering of fruit
and grain! You looked as if it might be your own
hair was rising to stand alone! We are but children
in the dark, Chico, and there come times when
we have fear. But your thought is the right
thought, lad. Of a certainty he crossed this country;
that there is no record is not so strange a thing&ndash;&ndash;he
was only another brown savage among many!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They spoke together of the strangeness of their
findings in the village&ndash;&ndash;and its exceeding good arrangement
with ladders to draw above in case of attack,
and only one house&ndash;&ndash;that of the doves and the
fruit&ndash;&ndash;into which one could walk from the court.
All the others were as in the other villages&ndash;&ndash;terraces,
and the first terrace had doors only in the roof
so that a blank adobe wall faced the court and the
curious. Each great house with rooms by the score,
and its height from two to five stories, was the home
of many, and a fort in case of need.</p>
<p>While they commented on these things, two men
came running swiftly through the gate from the
Castilian camp. One was Jos&eacute;, and it was Po-tzah
who ran beside him. They went straight to the
house of the dove cote, and Jos&eacute; waited without
while, after a few eager hurried words, the other
slipped behind the twinkling arras of river reeds and
shells.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; asked Don Ruy coming up, and
Jos&eacute; showed fear at first and then spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is your own horse to which it has happened,
Excellency,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The padre say it is not the
fault of any one, for the bush is high there, and who
could see through them? But it is the snake&ndash;&ndash;the
one you say has the castanets in the tail, and it has
put the poison in the foot of your horse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ruy swore an oath that was half a prayer,
and the pert secretary did the first thing that was
familiar since he was seen with the company&ndash;&ndash;he
laid his hand on Don Ruy&rsquo;s shoulder and felt that
the horse lost was as a brother lost, and Chico had
a fancy of his own to caress it, and even burnish the
silver of his bridle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;why come you here to this house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the one man who knows the ways of the
snake&ndash;&ndash;if he is not in prayer they think he may
come&ndash;&ndash;but not any man can know what the Po-Ahtun-ho
may do&ndash;&ndash;and the horse beautiful may die
on our first day in Povi-whah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the reeds with their copper and shell tassels
tinkled, and Don Ruy looked to see the old medicine
man of spells and charms come forth.</p>
<p>He saw a man young as himself and more tall.
Almost naked he was, with only the white banda in
which was a blue bird&rsquo;s feather&ndash;&ndash;the girdle and
moccasins. One glance he gave Don Ruy and his
companion, bent his head ever so little in acknowledgement
of their presence, and then ran beside his
friend Po-tzah with the easy stride of the trained
runner. Whatever his knowledge of the snake might
be, he waited for no words, but moved quickly.</p>
<p>Many men were about the animal and Don
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
Diego had bound tightly a cord of rawhide about the
knee, and water was being poured on the foot. But
Te-hua and Castilian alike stood aside as the swift
nude figure came among them&ndash;&ndash;and without word
or question went straight to the hurt animal.</p>
<p>The other natives had approached the four-footed
creatures with a certain curiosity&ndash;&ndash;if not awe, and
there had been more than a little scattering of prayer
meal when the mules were hobbled. The braying
of one of them had caused terror in the hearts of the
older men.</p>
<p>But this man took no heed of the groups of men or
of animals. He led the injured steed out of the pool
of water, and with a knife of the black flint cut the
bandage&ndash;&ndash;to the extreme distaste of Don Diego, who
had been chief surgeon.</p>
<p>Then, still without words to the people, he did a
strange thing, for he knelt there on the ground and
leaned his shoulder against the leg of the horse, and
slipped slowly, slowly down until his cheek touched
the pastern, and his strong slender hands slid downward
again and again over the leg of the animal
while his lips moved as though in whispered speech
to the ground itself.</p>
<p>No man spoke for a long time, but some of the
elder men cast prayer meal that it fell on the kneeling
savage and on the horse, and the animal reached
down and rubbed its nose on his shoulder as if he had
been its well known and long belov&eacute;d master.</p>
<p>Curious were all the Castilians, but Juan Gonzalvo,
who had spent time in speech with Yahn
Tsyn-deh, was more than curious. Like a tiger cat
above its prey he stood frowning at the silent &ldquo;medicine&rdquo;
of the naked worker in devilish arts.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>Then the kneeling man arose and spoke in Castilian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is done,&rdquo; but he did
not lift his eyes from the ground. The task of some
prayer was yet unfinished&ndash;&ndash;and he turned again towards
his home and walked swiftly and the horse
followed him until Juan Gonzalvo caught it and gave
careful heed to the stricken foot, and could see no
sign where the swelling should be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is big medicine,&rdquo; said the Te-hua men. &ldquo;Now
our brothers, the strangers have seen that our god is
strong and our men to work are strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is sorcery of the devil,&rdquo; said Juan Gonzalvo.
&ldquo;Some medicine he had in his hands&ndash;&ndash;some medicine
we could not see. No physician in all Europe
has skill to cure by such magic. Is it like that a
naked savage should know more than the learned
professors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No:&ndash;&ndash;it is not to be believed,&rdquo; assented Don
Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but thanks to the Saints it is true for all
that!&ndash;&ndash;and that silent youth is after all Tahn-t&eacute; the
Cacique!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; said Padre Vicente with decision&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the
sooner that office is no longer his the sooner do we
arrive at that which brought us here. That is
Tahn-t&eacute; the worker in accursed red magic&ndash;&ndash;Tahn-t&eacute;
the sorcerer!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>A PAGAN PRIEST IN COUNCIL</h3>
</div>
<p>Little else was spoken of in the camp of the
Castilians, but the witchcraft of the noble
steed. The more pious picketed their own
animals at a respectful distance from the one healed
by sorcery.</p>
<p>Don Diego took the healing as a sign that the
Evil One walked openly between the rows of the
adobe dwellings, and that the field camp was a safer
haven than a house whose every corner was, without
doubt, a matter of unsanctified prayer in the building.</p>
<p>Others there were who had grown weary of drenchings
of summer rains, and Yahn, hearing their arguments,
warned them that old Khen-yah the rain priest
was making medicine for more corn rains&ndash;&ndash;they
could easily hear his tomb&eacute; if they but hearkened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we can easily do without any strain to our
ears,&rdquo; agreed Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but what of that? Is a
piece of hide tied around a hollow log to serve as
thunder from which the rain must come, whether or
no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did not grasp his raillery and liked it
little. When Don Ruy spoke to her&ndash;&ndash;or spoke of
her, she felt she was being laughed at. Only her
determination to be in some way a power through
these strange people, kept her from betraying her
anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rain comes,&rdquo; she stated coldly. &ldquo;The
drum of Khen-yah never rests in quiet until it does
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
come. One night and one day he has made medicine&ndash;&ndash;soon
it must come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I cast my vote for the cover of a solid
roof, gentlemen,&rdquo; decided Don Ruy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had one
taste of their red magic&ndash;&ndash;it was speedy and effectual.
If the old magician should decide to send us a
flood, the sorcery would not be so much to my liking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some further discourse all agreed to accept
the offered dwelling, though Don Diego warned Don
Ruy it was unwise to speak in so light a manner of
the power of the Evil One when it was rampant in
the land. Already he had taken up the valiant battle
for converts. His success was gratifying in that one
woman had without understanding, yet with pleasurable
smiles listened to the credo, and had accepted
with equal gratification a string of blue beads of glass,
and a rosary.&ndash;&ndash;It was S&auml;h-pah. She had found
courage to slip alone into the camp while Yahn talked
in the village. After the little matter of the beads
she at once became as a shadow to Don Diego, who
had great confidence of leading her away from her
false gods. When he stated his pious hope to the
official interpreter of Don Ruy, that damsel seemed
little gifted with the devout apprehension or sisterly
affection so much to be desired in females. She was
angry because of the blue beads, and later, when the
sulkiness had departed enough that her tongue found
again its right usage, she stated that the pious Don
Diego would find little trouble in leading S&auml;h-pah to
any place he chose&ndash;&ndash;nor would any other man who
wanted a convert!</p>
<p>Whereupon the eager and pious gentleman gave
thanks&ndash;&ndash;let the others discuss civil or ecclesiastical
rule among the savage people&ndash;&ndash;or even risk their
souls in dealings with sorcerers, but he had made the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
only convert on this first day, and thus it was recorded
by the secretary on the first page of the &ldquo;Relaciones&rdquo;
pertaining to the chapters of Povi-whah, in that part
of the &ldquo;Province of New Spain in the Indian Island
which is refreshed by the majestical stream called in
the savage language P[=o]-s[=o]n-g&eacute;, but the same called by
the Castilians the Rio Bravo and the Rio Grande
del Norte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yahn Tsyn-deh took with all seriousness her office
as an adjunct of the Castilian camp, and Ka-yemo
who also gave help in the tradings for corn, and for
wood, and the various needs of the camp, found her
there always except when she slept, and he went back
and forth like a tethered beast, and dared not command
her. He had not thought about her except to
laugh in anger ever since a dawn when he had walked
out of her dwelling because of her witch&rsquo;s temper and
her tongue of a fiend:&ndash;&ndash;and that day he had gone
straight as the ravens fly, to the house of his oldest
relative, and told him he wished to be married as
early as might be to Koh-p&eacute;, the daughter of Tsa-fah.
Then to the wilderness he had gone hunting, leaving
all of trouble behind him while the two clans made
the marriage.&ndash;&ndash;When he came back again to his
people all was decided&ndash;&ndash;and he laughed loud in the
face of Yahn&ndash;&ndash;and passed her by, and carried fresh
killed rabbits to the door of Koh-p&eacute;.</p>
<p>That was how it had ended between them. Not
once afterwards had he spoken to her until he met her
as she walked triumphant and very proud beside the
Castilians at the gateway. Triumphant and very
proud did she continue to walk, and insolent were her
eyes when she let them rest on the husband of Koh-p&eacute;.
In vain he talked to the governor that she might be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
banished with the other women who were young.
Ka-yemo found himself laughed at by the Te-hua
men;&ndash;&ndash;was he angry because the Castilian capitan
of war could give the girl beads of red shell and
bracelets of white metal&ndash;&ndash;while he&ndash;&ndash;Ka-yemo&ndash;&ndash;had
not given her even meat from the hunt all those
summers and winters when she had been his love?</p>
<p>So the men laughed&ndash;&ndash;and told him each new
gift given to the one woman who knew Castilian
words&ndash;&ndash;and he laughed also as one does who cares
little, but in his heart was growing rage such as he
had never known could be in him. The man who
was sentinel of Povi-whah while the stars shone was
visited in the night by Ka-yemo the chief of war,
and the governor Phen-tsa was well pleased when he
heard it. To be married had, he thought, made a
stronger man of Ka-yemo, for never before had he
watched with the sentinel through the night, except
the nights of the young moon when it was part of his
work to watch, and to make reports of the things in
the sky to the Po-Ahtun-ho.</p>
<p>And no one guessed that while his visit to the
sentinel on the highest terrace had been brief&ndash;&ndash;his
walks past the dwelling of Yahn Tsyn-deh had been
many, and first and last had he halted and lay flat on
the roof and put his soul into his ears to know that she
slept soundly, and&ndash;&ndash;alone!</p>
<p>Then, angry in his heart with everybody&ndash;&ndash;he went
to the kiva of his clan where all the boys and the men
slept&ndash;&ndash;and the sun was high and even the youngest
boy had gone out to eat before he wakened and
looked on the world. When he did so he found that
many visitors were abroad. From Po-ho-g&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;and
Oj-ke&ndash;&ndash;and Na-im-be and even far Ui-la-ua were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
men sent by council as if to a feast. The presence
of all these men meant that they burned to know why
the men of iron had come to the North.</p>
<p>They all spoke first with the governor, as was
courtesy, and then on his good report of their good
intent&ndash;&ndash;they all approached the door of the Castilians,
where smiles and greetings were exchanged,
and those who breathed on the hand of the adventurers
were asked also to kiss the silver figure on
the cross of the padre, which they did with all courtesy
since their hosts required it, and then with smoke to
the pagan gods of the four ways, they all entered
into converse of great intent, though the meanings
at times were not so clearly understood each by the
other, for all the help of Jos&eacute; and of Yahn.</p>
<p>To tell an Indian that the Sacred Four Ways means
not anything to the greatest of all gods, is a thing of
confusion, more especially so when told that a sacred
three is the real combination by which entrance to
the paradise of an after life is made beyond all question
a thing of certainty.</p>
<p>To the adventurer of the 16th century dire mishaps
were to be expected if the Faith was not thus
clearly borne, and set plainly before the heathen.
Let him reject it if he choose, and die the absolute
death of body and soul for such rejection,&ndash;&ndash;let the
search for gold or jewel be postponed as may be, but
the first duty under authority civil or ecclesiastic
must be the duty to the faith in the One God and
Him crucified:&ndash;&ndash;it opened the portal in a god-fearing,
orthodox manner to any traffic deemed of advantage
to the adventurers who bore the faith, and the
cross;&ndash;&ndash;on the hilts of swords!</p>
<p>The visitors listened with ceremonial courtesy to
the words of the padre&ndash;&ndash;and heard of the glories
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
of the great Castilian king, the chosen of God&ndash;&ndash;the
pure and undefiled, and, of the still greater monarch
above the skies, served by this king and by all
righteous people to all ends of the earth.</p>
<p>In reply to which godly disquisition, the spokesman
of Na-im-be and Te-tzo-ge invited the followers of
the True God to a feast where only strong men could
come. The women of the dance in that feast were
strong and were young. Four days would the dance
and the feast last. The padre who spoke for the
high god could choose which of his men could enter
the dance for that time.</p>
<p>The padre heard without special wonder, he had
known many primitive people; but Don Diego was
lost in amaze as the details were spelled clearly for
his understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is worship of Pan driven out of Greek temples
to find lodging in this wilderness!&rdquo; and he crossed
himself with persistence and energy, and marvelled
at the quiet of Padre Vicente. Or, &ldquo;it is the ancient
devils of Babylon to which these heathen give
worship&ndash;&ndash;Saint Dominec hear them! They
would instruct their very gods in creation!&ndash;&ndash;Blasphemy
most damnable!&ndash;&ndash;Blasphemy against the
Ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon he went in search of his secretary to
make record of the abomination, and found that
youth witnessing the pagan baptism by which Ysobel
was made a daughter of her husband&rsquo;s clan&ndash;&ndash;each
way he turned he found primitive rites bewildering
and endless! All work done was done in prayer to
their false gods. From the blessing of the seed corn
laid away in the husk, until the time when it was put
in the earth,&ndash;&ndash;and the first ear ready for the roasting
fire&ndash;&ndash;at each and every stage he was told of special
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
ceremonies required,&ndash;&ndash;and as with the corn, so with
the human plant&ndash;&ndash;at each distinctive stage in the
growth of a man or woman child, open ceremonial
thanks was given to their deities whose names were
too depraved for any Christian man to remember.</p>
<p>Where the pious Se&ntilde;or Brancedori had expected
a virgin field for a wondrous mission, he found an
ancient province with ceremonies complicated as any
of ancient Hebrew or Greek tradition. Each little
toddler of the clan put forth a baby hand to touch the
head of Ysobel in sign of welcome, and one woman
came whose brow was marked with pi&ntilde;on gum&ndash;&ndash;and
he was told that the sign was that of maternity;&ndash;&ndash;all
who were to be mothers must wear a prayer symbol
to the Maiden Mother of the god who was born of a
dream in the shadow of the pi&ntilde;on tree!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I myself dream while wide awake, or do I
hear this thing?&rdquo; he demanded of Jos&eacute;, in sore distress
to divide the false from the true, and impress
the last on those well satisfied minds. &ldquo;Is it miracles
as well as sorcery their misled magicians make
jugglery of? When did this thing happen of which
the shameless wenches parade the symbol?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yahn asked of an aged Te-hua man the question,
and the man squatted in the sun and began ceremoniously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Han-na-di Set-en-dah-nh!</i> It was in the ancient
day when the people yet abode in the cliff dwellings
of the high land. It was the time of the year when
the stars danced for the snow, and as the time of the
Maid-Mother came close, the sun hid his face a little
more each day, and the longest night of all the nights
in the year was the time of that birth of the god
Po-se-yemo. The sun went away on the south trail
and would not look on the earth until the god-child
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
was born, for the Maid-Mother was much troubled,
and the sun was sad because of her trouble. That
is how it was, and each year the people remember
that time, and make ready for the twilight trail if
the god in the sun should not come again from the
south,&ndash;&ndash;but each time the sun god listens to the
prayers and comes back and all are very glad. <i>Han-na-di
Set-en-dah-nh!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maestro Diego seated himself in a disconsolate
mood at this artifice of Satan thus to engraft heathen
rubbish on the childish minds of the natives:&ndash;&ndash;for
that they did lean on that faith the mark of the
pi&ntilde;on symbol was a witness before his eyes! It was
a thing to dishearten even a true believer, and he
feared much that Padre Vicente passed over many
signs of the devil worship each hour&ndash;&ndash;not realizing
that it must be dug out, root and branch, ere the
planting of the cross would mean aught but the Ways
of the Four Winds to these brown builders of stone
and mortar, and weavers of many clothes!</p>
<p>Juan Gonzalvo found him there disconsolate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not any wondrous thing of the Blessed Twelve
can you recite to the animals and win even a surprise,&rdquo;
he lamented to this pious comrade in the cause.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;To
tell them that the eye of their creator watches them
from the skies is to bring only a retort that the great
god has as many eyes as the stars&ndash;&ndash;and sees through
all of them at once! Their deceitful visions are such
that even the miracles make naught of wonder in their
darkened souls. They are not of doubting minds
like to Thomas the tardy!&ndash;&ndash;they accept all the records
of the Faith as they would accept a good dinner&ndash;&ndash;and
then tell you that the fair victuals in the pot
had been cooked by themselves time out of mind in
a different, and more seasonable way! Everything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
but Satan himself do they believe, him they deny
previous acquaintance with until told by me of his
reality!&ndash;&ndash;but in secret there is not any doubt that
they do give him worship since he of course inspires
their devilish heresies. Padre Vicente has the work
of a saint facing him in this place, since only a miracle
can make them Christian men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gonzalvo was of the opinion that the good padre
was disturbed over temporal things requiring prayer
and thought. Between their visitors of the morning,
discourse had been made of the fruitless quest of
Capitan Coronado for the smile of the sun which became
yellow metal in the earth. It was secret speech,
for neither of the interpreters had disclosed it. The
quick ear of Padre Vicente had caught the meaning.
Also the visitors from other villages were plainly
here to see what action the Po-Ahtun-ho of Povi-whah
was to take, and there were some who deemed him
too youthful to be a leader&ndash;&ndash;which the padre gave
agreement to. Also it was clear to his reverence
that the youthful magician was the guardian of the
gold, and must in some way be bought or mastered.</p>
<p>While they talked, and weighed as might be the
complications to be met, a messenger from the governor
came to them, and touched them with a slender
wand of office that they follow him. As they did
so, Jos&eacute; came to them, and said that at last it was
plain the Cacique meant to see both red and white
visitors in the kiva of the Po-Ahtun. No secret
things could be spoken to him,&ndash;&ndash;all must hear the
talk with the strangers! Jos&eacute; was to go, and
Ka-yemo the war chief, every one who knew both
Te-hua and Castilian words&ndash;&ndash;every one was to go
but the damsel Yahn Tsyn-deh.</p>
<p>The governor and the Ka-yemo appeared dressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
in their most gorgeous robes of fur, feathers, and
painted skins. Also Ka-yemo wore much of the
wealth of his wife in shell beads about his neck.</p>
<p>Taking a timely hint, Don Ruy appeared in unusual
magnificence. He carried the standard of Spain
and walked beside the padre who bore the cross.
Behind them came Chico the secretary bearing the
embroidered vest and cap of Don Diego with which
they made him grand when they discovered him on
the way.</p>
<p>Half the Castilians marched in order in the rear
and formed for guard at a respectful distance under
Capitan Gonzalvo. Seeing that all was well, he
mounted the steps to the roof, and was the last to
descend into the sanctuary.</p>
<p>One Te-hua sentinel stood on guard for his people
at the place of council, and the serene life of the
village went on as if no mail clad men were within
its walls, only the children who were small, and the
boys who were curious, loitered close and wondered
of what the men of the beards wove their armor, for
the water bottles woven of reeds and plastered with
gum of the pi&ntilde;on had that same glazed surface.
Strange things must grow where these men grew!</p>
<p>In the circle of the council home it was an impressive
line of men who faced each other in silence.
Chico half in earnest, announced in a whisper to Don
Ruy that the ladder of the entrance would be his
choice of a seat;&ndash;&ndash;so as to be nearest the outside
world in case of trouble.</p>
<p>Shadowy it was in the great room where only the
way of the sky gave light, and the only seat was that
built around the wall&ndash;&ndash;and to Don Ruy was like to
pictures of the old Roman ruins. The walls were
white, and there were lines and strange symbols in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
pale green, and in yellow:&ndash;&ndash;the colors of the Summer
People. An altar of stone was directly under
the ladder, and the light from above fell on the terraced
back of it&ndash;&ndash;typifying the world of valley, and
mesa, and highest level. A ceremonial bowl of red
ware echoed this form on its four terraced sides. It
held white and yellow pollen, and the sacred corn of
four colors formed a cross with the bowl as a center;&ndash;&ndash;all
this was placed before the statue of a seated
god carved from red stone. The arms were folded
and the pose was serene&ndash;&ndash;waiting! But as fragrant
bark was tossed on the sacred fire below him,&ndash;&ndash;and
a flame awoke for a moment, the eyes reflected the
light in a startling way&ndash;&ndash;as though alive! Then
the strangers saw that the eyes were of iridescent
shell set in the carven stone,&ndash;&ndash;and more strange than
all was the fact that the god of the altar was a weeping
god, and the tear under each eye was also of the
strange shell mosaic. It was the Earth-Born God
who had been driven out by the proud hearts of the
Lost Others. Weeping, he waited the Sign in the
Sky by which he was to return. His name meant
Dew of Heaven&ndash;&ndash;and the Dew and the Sun must
work together for the best life of growing things, and
of human things.</p>
<p>Among all the swart elderly faces it was an easy
matter to pick the man who had given back to him
the steed. The eyes of Don Ruy sought him eagerly,
and more than ever wondered at the youth of him,
and the countenance fairer than many a Castilian of
their land. The other glimpses of him had been brief,
and when kneeling by the horse, his face had been all
but hidden.</p>
<p>He wore no ceremonial festive garb as did the
others. The white robe of deerskin was folded about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
him, and he gave no heed to the different visitors who
entered. His eyes were on the floor as though in
meditation, and in silence he accepted the sacred
smoke, and then glanced towards the place where the
governor sat always when in council. After that one
little look there was no longer silence. The padre,
watching the impassive young face, observed that one
glance was all that was required of command. And
the governor of Povi-whah arose and spoke.</p>
<p>He told to the brothers and neighbors of the coming,
and the kindly coming, of the Castilians to bring
back in safety one Te-hua man who had been carried
far south as a slave. The man of the grey robe was
the priest of the Castilian god, and that god had
sent him to say that all men must be brothers, with
the god in the sky for a father. These new brothers
brought good gifts and tokens from their king. The
king said his children would also help fight the wild
Apache and Navahu and Yutah in the day when they
came to kill and take captives.</p>
<p>Smiles went over many faces in the circle. Nods
of approval gave good hope for the Castilian cause.</p>
<p>Then the governor of Kah-po arose.</p>
<p>This coming of the strange brothers was good, he
agreed. It was much for nothing. How many
fields for corn would the Castilian brothers ask for
such help in battle?</p>
<p>The padre lifted the cross, and stood up, and the
Castilians knelt on the stone floor with heads low
bowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of fields of mortal man we ask no more than the
corn we eat&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he said&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but the great god decreed
that each soul for salvation must be written by the
priest in the great record. Baptism must they accept,&ndash;&ndash;and
new prayers to the true god must they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
learn. Out of the far land had the true god made
the trail that the faith be carried to the Te-hua people.
Under the cross he wished to give the sacrament of
baptism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kneeling Castilians impressed the pagan men
more than might have been hoped. They were strong&ndash;&ndash;yet
they were as bidden children under that Symbol.
It was big medicine! Ka-yemo found his own head
bowed lower and lower&ndash;&ndash;the spell of the older days
was working!&ndash;&ndash;when he lifted his eyes, it was to see
the brief glance of Tahn-t&eacute; rest on him. He sat
erect again as though a spoken command was in that
look. All this saw Don Ruy, and all this saw the
padre, and his teeth locked close under his beard.</p>
<p>Many were the exchange of thought over faiths
old and faiths new in the land, also of the ancient
republics, the Pueblos, and the interest of the majestic
ruler who was king of Spain and the Indies was
made manifest by his subjects. Of many things did
they speak until all the old men had spoken, and it
was plain to be seen that the Castilians were not unwelcome.
The winning courtesy of Don Ruy made
many friends, and the wise brain of the padre made
no mistakes. Yet of the one central cause of the
quest not any one had spoken, and the silent Cacique
had only designated by a glance or a motion of the
hand who was to be the next spokesman. He was
the youngest of all, and he waited to listen.</p>
<p>Then, when the smoke had been long, and silence
had been long, Tahn-t&eacute; the wearer of the white robe
arose. For a space he stood with folded arms
wrapped in the mantle of high office, and quietly let
his gaze rest on one after another of those in the circle,
halting last at Ka-yemo whose glance fell under his
own&ndash;&ndash;and whose head bent as under accusation.</p>

<p>Tahn-t&eacute; smiled, but it was not a glad smile&ndash;&ndash;he
had seen that the old magic of the gray robe was
holding the war chief in thrall to the strangers.</p>
<p>Then Tahn-t&eacute; stepped forward from the seat of
council&ndash;&ndash;and threw aside the white robe, and slender
and nude as the Indian gods are nude but for the
girdle, and the medicine pouch, he stood erect, looking
for the first time direct and steadily into the eyes of
Padre Vicente. The circle of the council room might
have been an arena and only those two facing each
other and measuring each other.</p>
<p>While one might count ten he stood thus silent, and
Don Ruy could hear his own heart beat, and Chico
clutched at the embroidered doublet of Don Diego,
and wished for the sound of any man&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Then Tahn-t&eacute; smiled as the eyes of Padre Vicente
wavered, as Ka-yemo&rsquo;s had wavered&ndash;&ndash;the boy who
had tamed serpents felt the strength of the hills with
him. Always he felt strong when he stood alone!</p>
<p>From the medicine pouch he took the gift of the
rosary, and held it aloft that all might see, and the
silver Christ on it caught the light from the opening
in the roof, and swung and circled like a thing alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he said in Spanish though slowly,
as one little used to the speech&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;one of those
among you has done me the honor to send me a gift
and a message. I was making prayers at that time,&ndash;&ndash;I
have not been free to return thanks until now
in the council. I do so, and I speak in Spain&rsquo;s words
as this is not a Te-hua matter. It is a gift from a
Christian to a Pagan, and the message told me a king
would be proud to wear this strand of carven beads.
Se&ntilde;ores:&ndash;&ndash;I am no king, kings give royal bounties
to each giver of a gift. I stand naked that you see
with your own eyes how little I can accept,&ndash;&ndash;since
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
in return I can give not anything! Take back your
kingly gift, Se&ntilde;or Priest:&ndash;&ndash;I cannot exchange for it
even&ndash;&ndash;a soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped lightly as a panther of the hills across
the open space and let fall the beads into the hands
of Padre Vicente.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you may save it for the king, Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; he
said gently, and bowing with more of grace than a
courtier who does homage, he returned to his place.</p>
<p>Padre Vicente turned gray white under the tan.
Don Diego crossed himself and muttered a prayer.
Juan Gonzalvo uttered an expletive and half smothered
it in a gasp as the face of Tahn-t&eacute; caught the
light for one instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood of Christ!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he whispered&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;look at
his eyes&ndash;&ndash;his eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ruy caught the arm of the man and pressed
it for warning to silence. When he turned a more
composed face to the circle, the secretary was looking
at him and there was something like terror in the face
of the lad. Each knew the thought of the other&ndash;&ndash;each
remembered the words of Juan Gonzalvo at
Ah-ko,&ndash;&ndash;also the basket of the sacred first fruit at
the portal under the dove cote&ndash;&ndash;also the blue eyes
of the Greek&ndash;&ndash;blue with lashes so long and so heavy
that black might be their color. The pagan priest
would need all the help of his gods if Juan Gonzalvo
caught this thought of theirs!</p>
<p>Padre Vicente recovered himself, kissed the crucifix
and slipped it within his robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The words of this man are the words Satan is
clever in coining when the false gods speak and reject
the true,&rdquo; he stated quietly. &ldquo;My children, we must
not hold this against the weak human brother. The
devils of necromancy and sorcery are stubborn&ndash;&ndash;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
ere this the stubbornness has been broken, and the
saints have rejoiced! It is plain that devilish arts
could not prosper where the Image remained&ndash;&ndash;hence
it has been given back! Make no mistake my children,
where the word of God, and the Image rest,&ndash;&ndash;there
the pagan powers must ever grow weak.
Thanks be that this is so! Remember it&ndash;&ndash;all of
you when you pray!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Diego started his prayers at once, while Juan
Gonzalvo leaned forward and stared at the pagan
sorcerer like a hound held in leash.</p>
<p>The Te-hua men had heard only gentle tones from
Tahn-t&eacute; and thought little of the strange change in
the faces of the Castilians.&ndash;&ndash;Tahn-t&eacute; many times
said surprising things&ndash;&ndash;that was all!</p>
<p>But Tahn-t&eacute;, listening closely to the priestly admonition
as Padre Vicente grasped all the meaning of
it. He was being branded as a worker of evil magic&ndash;&ndash;a
<i>sorcerer</i>&ndash;&ndash;the most difficult accusation of all to
fight down in an Indian mind!</p>
<p>He looked from face to face of the strangers&ndash;&ndash;halted
at the secretary, but seeing there either fear or
sympathy&ndash;&ndash;his eyes sought further, and rested on
Don Ruy.</p>
<p>Then he drew from his medicine pouch a second
rosary, a beautifully wrought thing of ebony and gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or&rdquo; he said,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;if I mistake not, it was your
animal I helped but yesterday. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in truth&ndash;&ndash;and much am I in your debt
for that help!&rdquo; said Ruy Sandoval with heartiness&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;it
is no fault of mine that I am late in rendering
thanks. You deny that you are king&ndash;&ndash;yet I have
known majesty easier to approach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the animal is now well, and shows no marks
of the Christian&rsquo;s Satan?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sound:&ndash;&ndash;every inch of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks that you say so, and that you do not fear
to say so,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;. &ldquo;Since it is so, it makes
clear that the printed word, or the graven image is no
weight to True Magic, even when taught us by pagan
gods! For ten years I have read, day time and night
time, all there is to read in the books of your church
left by Padre Luis&ndash;&ndash;also all the other books left
by the men of Se&ntilde;or Coronado&rsquo;s company, and by
Padre Juan Padilla who died at Ci-bo-la. Side by
side I have studied the wisdom of these books, and
the wisdom of our ancient people of the Te-hua, as
told to me by the old men. One has never held me
from seeing clear that which I read in the other, and
the graven image has only the Meaning and the
Power which each man gives to it! It was with me
when I took away the sting of the Brother Snake.
Padre Luis was a man who would have been a good
man in any religion&ndash;&ndash;that is why I kept this symbol
of him&ndash;&ndash;not for the crucified god on it! But for
the sake of the god, is it sacred to you because your
heart tells you to think that way. It is right to be
what a man&rsquo;s heart tells him to be. I give you the
prayer beads. I give it to you because your horse
helped me to show your people that the pagan gods are
strong, if the heart of the man is strong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Relaciones&rdquo; Don Diego wrote that&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;The
horrification of that moment was a time men
might live through but could not write of.&ndash;&ndash;For myself
I know well that only the invisible army of the
angels kept the beams of the roof from crushing us, as
well as the poor pagans, who sat themselves still in a
circle with pleasant countenances!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruy Sandoval knew courage of any kind when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
saw it, and he met Tahn-t&eacute; midway of the council
and accepted the rosary of beauty from his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My thanks to you, Se&ntilde;or Cacique,&rdquo; he said&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the
more so for the care given this relic. The
Fray Luis de Escalona was known of my mother&ndash;&ndash;also
was known the lady from whom this went to his
hand. A goldsmith of note fashioned it, and its
history began in a palace;&ndash;&ndash;strange that its end
should be found here in the desert of the Indies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end has perhaps not yet been found, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;said
the Indian,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;thanks that you accept it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he spoke in Te-hua to the people as if every
personal incident with the Castilians was forever
closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have listened to fair words from these men&ndash;&ndash;and
to sweet words of brother and brother. I
have waited until all of you spoke that I might know
your hearts. You are proud that they come over all
the deserts and seek you for friends. Have you asked
them why it is so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one had asked why all the other tribes were
left behind, and why the strangers had come to camp
at the Rio Grande del Norte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are good people,&rdquo; stated one man, and the
others thought that was so, and a fair enough reason.</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; listened, and then spoke to the Castilians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have come far, Se&ntilde;ores, and my people have
not yet heard the true reason of the honor you pay
them. The priest always goes&ndash;&ndash;and the tale told
is that it is for souls&ndash;&ndash;(Father Luis truly did believe
it was for souls!) But your books tell plainly one
thing, and the Christian men I knew taught by their
lives the same thing, and it was this:&ndash;&ndash;For gold,
for precious stones,&ndash;&ndash;or for women&ndash;&ndash;are the real
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
things which your kings send out companies of men
in search of. Women you could find without crossing
the desert. This Te-hua man who was first captive,
and then slave, would have come in gladness to his
people if let go free, yet for five summers and winters
did the Castilian priest hold him servant and at last
comes with him to his home. Is this because of love?
His reverence, the padre, is wise in much with men,&ndash;&ndash;but
great love is not his; I cannot see him starving
in a cave, and blessing his tormentors as did Fray
Luis. So, Se&ntilde;ores, the reason must be made more
clear. Se&ntilde;or Coronado sought gold&ndash;&ndash;and full freedom
was given him to find gold&ndash;&ndash;if he could! Why
is your desire to fight for us against the Apache and
the Yutah&ndash;&ndash;and what is the thing you ask in exchange?
Not yet have we had any plain word as
from your king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ruy smiled at his logic. Here was no untutored
savage such as they had hoped to buy with
glass beads&ndash;&ndash;or perhaps a mule the worse for the
journey! However it ended, he was getting more
of adventure than if he had built a ship to sail the
coasts!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Games have been won by Truth ere now even
though Truth be not popular,&rdquo; he said to the padre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not fitting that his Reverence should make
reply,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;put in Don Diego with much anger.
&ldquo;Holy Church is insulted in his person. If this
were but Madrid&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To wish for Paradise takes no more of breath,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;suggested
Don Ruy, &ldquo;and if it is beneath the dignity
of any else, perhaps I could speak&ndash;&ndash;or Chico
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the latter silently disclaimed gift of logic or
oratory,&ndash;&ndash;in fact the turn of things was not toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
gaity. Don Diego was shocked at everything said.
Gonzalvo and the padre were plainly furious, yet
bound to silence. Only Don Ruy could still smile.
To him it was a game good as a bull fight&ndash;&ndash;and
much more novel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall speak, though it be a task I elsewhere
evade,&rdquo; he said, and looked at the Cacique&ndash;&ndash;a
solitary nude bronze body amidst all the gay trappings
of the assembly. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, it is not women we
seek&ndash;&ndash;though a few of us might make room for a
pretty one! It is true that the men in armor would
help guard your fields, for they have heard that you
are the Children of the Sun as were certain people
of the south. In the south the sun sent a sign to
his children&ndash;&ndash;it was gold set in the ledges of the
rock, or the gravel of the stream. If these people
of the Rio Grande del Norte can show these signs
that they be given as proof to our king&ndash;&ndash;then men
in armor of steel will come many as bees on the
blossom and guard your land that your corn and your
women be ever safe from the wild Indians who make
devastation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; repeated this to the Te-hua men without
comment of his own, and the dark faces were watched
by the Castilians. They could see no eagerness&ndash;&ndash;only
a little wonder&ndash;&ndash;and from some a shrug or
smile,&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;not from any of them anger or fierce
looks!</p>
<p>The padre drew a quiet breath of content and
leaned back&ndash;&ndash;the game was at least even. The
Navahu had been bad for two years&ndash;&ndash;very bad!
The appeal of Don Ruy might prove the right thing,
and the simple thing. It would take time, for the
Indian mind was slow;&ndash;&ndash;the quickness of the naked
sorcerer proved nothing otherwise, for every god-fearing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
man could see that he was more than mortal
in satanic strength. Against this one man alone must
the battle for the Trinity be fought!</p>
<p>Together did the Te-hua men of council speak
much&ndash;&ndash;and to Ka-yemo they turned more than once
and asked of the Tiguex days of the other Christian
men. But between the devil of the padre and his
symbols and the deep sea of the eyes of Tahn-t&eacute;,
not much was to be remembered by a man, and he
could only say that his stay in the south was not long&ndash;&ndash;that
he was only a boy, and without the understanding
of things done and seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have spoken,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;said Tahn-t&eacute; when the older
men turned to him for council as to the wisdom of
throwing away so powerful a friend as the men of
iron. Some were concerned lest they should turn
away and offer help to their enemies!</p>
<p>In the land of the Yutah the yellow stones were
found in the stream&ndash;&ndash;also in the heart of the Navahu
desert. No people used these stones because they
were sacred to the sun, and strong for prayer, but&ndash;&ndash;it
was well to think what would happen if the
men of iron were brothers to the Navahu!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never more could we sleep under our own roof&ndash;&ndash;or
plant corn in our own fields,&rdquo; said the man
from Te-tzo-ge,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;our daughters would be wives to
the Navahu and mothers of Navahu, and the grass
would grow over the walls we have builded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They smoked in silence over this thought, for it was
a dark thought&ndash;&ndash;and it could come true!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could kill these few, and then sleep sound for
a long time with no trouble thoughts,&rdquo; suggested one,
a patriarch from Ui-la-ua.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but if we do that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
way we would be no better than these men of iron.
Their god talks two ways for killing, and their
men live two ways. Our god when he taught our
fathers, gave them but one law for killing, it was
this:&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;Go not to battle. A time will come for you
to fight, and the stars in the sky will mark that time.
When the star of the ice land moves&ndash;&ndash;then the
battle time will be here! Until then live as brothers
and make houses&ndash;&ndash;use the spear only when the
enemy comes to break your walls.&rsquo; That is the
world of the Great Ruler. To kill these men only
holds the matter for your sons to decide some other
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then is to do?&rdquo; demanded a man of Naim-be&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;they
do not break the walls, but they are
beside the gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Yutah and the Navahu traders come
with skin robes, what is it you do?&rdquo; asked Tahn-t&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We trade them our corn and our melons and we
get the robes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;added Tahn-t&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the governor of
each village gives them room outside the walls when
the night comes, and the chief of war sees that the
gate is closed, and that a guard never goes down from
the roof! If these men are precious to you, make of
them brothers, and send prayer thoughts on their
trail, but never forget that they are traders, and never
forget that the watchers must be on the roof so long
as they stay in your land! They come for that which
they can carry away, and once they have it you will
be in their hearts only as the grass of last year on the
hills&ndash;&ndash;a forgotten thing over which they ride to new
harvests!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk as one who has eaten always from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
same bowl with the strangers,&rdquo; spoke one man from
Oj-ke&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;yet you are young, and some of these men
are not young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;said Tahn-t&eacute; catching the implied
criticism of his youth and his prominence&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;because
in the talking paper which their god made, there is
records of all their men since ancient days. They
have never changed. Their gods tell them to go out
and kill and take all that which the enemy will not
give,&ndash;&ndash;to take also the maids for slaves,&ndash;&ndash;that is
their book of laws from the Beginning. Since I was
a boy I have studied all these laws. It was my work.
By the god a man has in his heart we can know the
man! Their god is a good god for traders, and a
strong god for war. But the watchers of the night
must never leave the gate unguarded when they camp
under the walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this Padre Vicente heard, all this and much of
it was comprehended by him. Plainly it was not
well to seek converts when the pernicious tongue of
the Cacique could speak in their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be that we abide many days beside you,&rdquo;
he said gently and with manner politic&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;also it
may be that we visit the wise men of the other villages,
and take to them the good will of our king.
The things said to-day we will think of kindly until
that time. And in the end you will all learn of the
true god, and will know that we have come to be your
brothers if you are the children of the true god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon which he held up the cross, and bent his head
as in prayer, and went first up the ladder into the
light. He was pale and the sweat stood on his face.
It had been a hard hour.</p>
<p>The others followed in due order, but Don Diego
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
eyed the wizard Cacique with a curiosity great as was
his horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone he has studied books without a tutor&ndash;&ndash;sacred
books&ndash;&ndash;since his boyhood!&rdquo; he said to Don
Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;think of that, and of the grief we had to
persuade you to the reading of even the saintly lives!
There is devilish art in this&ndash;&ndash;the angels guard us
from further sorcery&ndash;&ndash;without a tutor! A savage
magician to study strange tongues without a tutor!
It is nothing short of infernal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But despite all opinion, Don Ruy waited and approached
the man of the white robe and the cruel
logic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been my friend,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he said&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;will
you not eat with me and talk in quiet of these
matters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not fear then to be marked as the comrade
of a sorcerer?&rdquo; asked Tahn-t&eacute;. &ldquo;You must
be a man of strength in your own land, Excellency,
to dare offend your priest by such offer. Is the Holy
Office no longer supreme in Spain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you&ndash;&ndash;an Indian&ndash;&ndash;know of the office,
of the duties of the workers there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two years of my life I lived in the camp of
Coronado. To listen was part of my work.
Strange and true tales were told in the long nights.
They are still with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;you will come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; looked at him and smiled&ndash;&ndash;but the smile
held no gladness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My thanks to you, Se&ntilde;or. To you I give the
prayer beads&ndash;&ndash;it is good to give them to you.
More than that is not for me to do. My work takes
me from where the feast songs are sung.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>Then he wrapped about him the white robe made
of deer skins, and it was as if he had enshrouded himself
in silence not to be broken.</p>
<p>With reluctance Don Ruy went up the ladder and
left him there. The sweetness of the outer air was
good after the reek of many smokes in the kiva&ndash;&ndash;and
the adventurer stood on the terrace and drew
great breaths and gazed across the tree fringed
water, and thought it all a goodly sight well worth
the jealousy of the pagan guardian.</p>
<p>Don Diego had accompanied the padre to their
own quarters, but Juan Gonzalvo was across the court
speaking quietly to Yahn Tsyn-deh whose vanity required
some soothing that she had been shut out by
Tahn-t&eacute; from council and her coveted official tasks.</p>
<p>At the wall of the terrace waited the secretary in
some hesitation, yet striving for boyish courage to
speak the things outside the duty of his office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pardon, Excellency,&rdquo; he said lowly. &ldquo;It
is not for me to advise, but I heard some words of
the two over there&ndash;&ndash;may I speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lad, and quickly as may be. Their two
heads are over close together for discretion. I fear
I shall have the task and expense of providing a
duenna for my beauteous interpreter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little enough of love there is with that dame!&rdquo;
commented the other,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;it is hate&ndash;&ndash;your Excellency&ndash;&ndash;and
for you to say whether their private hates
may not be a breeder of woe for all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and Don Ruy motioned with
his head towards the kiva.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes:&ndash;&ndash;it is the Cacique. The woman for some
cause is bitter with hate against him.&ndash;&ndash;Juan Gonzalvo
is eager to listen&ndash;&ndash;he is restless as quicksilver
already with suspicion of strange things. In the far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
south he and his comrades made little odds of riding
rough shod over the natives&ndash;&ndash;here he would do the
same at a word from the padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that word we can ill afford when we are but
a handful!&rdquo; decided Don Ruy,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Hum!&ndash;&ndash;for instant
annihilation of the proud pagan we can depend
on Gonzalvo, the padre, and Maestro Diego, if it
came to a showing of hands. There must be no
showing:&ndash;&ndash;Capitan Gonzalvo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gonzalvo crossed quickly to him, while Yahn stood
sulkily watching the three with lazy, half closed eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget none of the pagan Cacique&rsquo;s words&ndash;&ndash;or
his defiance of Holy Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His defiance of Holy God!&ndash;&ndash;Excellency,&rdquo; answered
Gonzalvo hotly,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and that is not all&ndash;&ndash;I
have heard things&ndash;&ndash;I am putting them together&ndash;&ndash;You
saw his eyes&ndash;&ndash;scarcely Indian eyes! You
heard his accursed logic of heresy&ndash;&ndash;not all Indian&ndash;&ndash;that!
Indians may think like that in their accursed
hearts, but they do not find the quick words to argue
with their superiors as does this insolent dog!
Listen, Don Ruy, for I have found the clue&ndash;&ndash;and
he belongs to me&ndash;&ndash;that man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you&ndash;&ndash;Capitan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me! You have listened to mad things of his
birth and of his clan&ndash;&ndash;the girl of the twilight and
the seed bearer&ndash;&ndash;well, what I tell you seems even
more mad, but it will be true if ever we get to the
end of it&ndash;&ndash;that story of the thrice accursed Teo the
Greek&ndash;&ndash;you recall it?&ndash;&ndash;he did without doubt cross
this river and saw the Pueblos,&ndash;&ndash;this sorcerer is of
his spawn&ndash;&ndash;he and his medicine mother come back in
good time with their Star God story, and the seeds&ndash;&ndash;the
identical seeds of the padre&rsquo;s story! See you not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
what it all leads to? He has the blood of the Greek
in him:&ndash;&ndash;in any Christian land he has enough of it
to be broken on the wheel for his damnable
heresies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;since we are not in a Christian land, and
doubtless shall never see him in a Christian land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That narrows it down to man and man, Excellency!
His father made a slave of mine&ndash;&ndash;my
earliest oath on the Cross and on the Faith, was
vengeance against the Greek and all his blood!
God of Heaven!&ndash;&ndash;to think that of all the priests of
Mexico you chose the one who knew that story!&ndash;&ndash;and
that of all the Indian tribes, we have come to the
one where the half Greek sorcerer rules like a Turk!
Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;you have led me north to vengeance&ndash;&ndash;my
sword and my arm are forever to your cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many thanks to you, Capitan, but in this case it
is not your sword I shall command&ndash;&ndash;except to remain
in its scabbard!&ndash;&ndash;but your speech I must
silence while we give this matter of the Cacique a
season of prayer and due consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency&ndash;&ndash;I do not understand&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand at least all that a soldier need,
Capitan,&rdquo; said Don Ruy with smiling ease. &ldquo;Your
commission comes from me,&ndash;&ndash;and I did not bestow
it for the furtherance of private quarrels. Until I
give the word, your speech must not again mention
the thing you suspect&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;the padre&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Least of all must the padre or Se&ntilde;or Brancedori
hear even a whisper of it! Neither private vengeance,
nor religious war must be pursued while the
company is on our present quest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have me break my oath on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
cross&ndash;&ndash;save a heretic alive who belongs in the deepest
pit?&ndash;&ndash;Excellency!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gonzalvo&rsquo;s voice had much of pleading. He felt
himself a man cheated of his righteous dues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your holy vengeance will keep until our quest
is over&ndash;&ndash;and the more time to prepare your soul,&rdquo;
suggested Don Ruy. &ldquo;Then&ndash;&ndash;if the gold is found,
and all goes well, you two can have open fight before
we take the road to the south. But until that lucky
hour, the first and the last word for you is&ndash;&ndash;silence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gonzalvo stood, staring in baffled rage. It was
to the padre he should have gone first. He had
played the wrong card in the game. Was Don Ruy
bewitched as well as his horse?</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least I shall have a double debt to pay when
my time does come, Excellency&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he said at last.
&ldquo;His pagan discourse warrants him a Christian knife,
and will insure him a corner of hell when I send him
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a respectful distance the secretary had seated
himself, and rested with brow on fists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;asked Don Ruy. &ldquo;You seem
little heartened by all this brave talk of righteousness.
Think you the monk&rsquo;s life of cloister and garden
looks fair after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth, Se&ntilde;or, if you have the desire to despatch
a lackey to your lady love across the sands, you
may choose me if you like!&rdquo; agreed the lad. &ldquo;I
have neither heart nor stomach for this contest of
souls or no souls&ndash;&ndash;the pagan blood for my far away
grandmother unfits me for judgement&ndash;&ndash;this heretic
of the white robe is fighting the same fight of my own
people&ndash;&ndash;but he fights it like one inspired by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
nahual of a god. Yet&ndash;&ndash;there is only one finish to
it! Bulls-hide shields and arrows stand not long before
steel coats and leaden bullets&ndash;&ndash;I would be elsewhere
when the finish comes, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nahual of a god!&rdquo; repeated Don Ruy,
&ldquo;now what may that mean in Christian speech?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Christian speech it does not exist&ndash;&ndash;the church
has spilled much blood that it be washed from the
pagan mind,&rdquo; said the lad. &ldquo;But the nahual is the
guardian angel or guardian devil born to earth with
each man&ndash;&ndash;it is like his shadow, yet unseen, it is
part of the Great Mystery from the other side of
the dawn and the other side of the dark. Once
open worship was given to the Nahual, and their
priests were strong. Now if the worshippers do
meet, it is in secret. This man has truly drawn to
himself a strong nahual and it should give him much
of the magic which the good padre tells us is accursed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a boy you have a fund of strange lore!&rdquo;
commented Don Ruy,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;too much for good company
in the night time,&ndash;&ndash;small wonder that you
range abroad and dream under the stars! The
monks never taught you all of it. Come:&ndash;&ndash;tell me
truly of your escapade&ndash;&ndash;what sent you to our
ranks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad flushed, then shrugged his shoulders and
regarded the toes of his sandals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency&ndash;&ndash;if you require that I tell you&ndash;&ndash;I
am most certain never to get the commission to carry
message to lady of yours!&rdquo; he said so whimsically
that the excellency laughed and promised him constant
employment on such embassies if fortune found
him ladies.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then:&ndash;&ndash;I must speak myself a failure! A
damsel did trust me with some such message to her
cavalier and seeing that the love was all on one side&ndash;&ndash;and
that side her own&ndash;&ndash;I dared not go back and
face her&ndash;&ndash;not even her guerdon could I by any
means steal from him; brief:&ndash;&ndash;I saved my neck by
following you and leaving the land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she so high in power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes:&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;no, Excellency. She was, with
all her estates, so close under the guard of the Viceroy
that she could win all favors but&ndash;&ndash;freedom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; queried Don Ruy with wrinkled brow&ndash;&ndash;his
thoughts travelling fast to the converse of the
gentle maniac as told him by the padre. &ldquo;Has the
Viceroy then a collection of pretty birds in cages&ndash;&ndash;and
must they sing only for the viceregal ear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell as to other cages, Se&ntilde;or, but this
one was meant to sing only for a viceregal relative:&ndash;&ndash;if
she proved heretic, then the convent waited and
her lands were otherwise disposed of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum! Then even in the provinces such rulings
work as swiftly as at court! Well, what outer
charge was there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strongest possible charge, Excellency. The
mother of the girl had Indian blood, and, despite
the wealth and Christian teaching of her husband&ndash;&ndash;returned
to Indian worship at his death. For that
she was called mad, and ended her days in a Convent.
The daughter of course will also be mad if she refuses
to be guided by the good friends who select her
husband&ndash;&ndash;that husband was her only gate to freedom,
knowing which the maid did certainly do some
mad things:&ndash;&ndash;to strangers she tried to speak&ndash;&ndash;from
her duenna she slipped out in the night time&ndash;&ndash;oh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
there is no doubt that all the evidence will show
plainly in court that she is more mad than her
mother&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chico!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;The hand of Don Ruy rested on the
shoulder of the lad&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;You are telling me the hidden
part of a story to which I have listened from other
lips&ndash;&ndash;and your eyes have tears in them!&ndash;&ndash;Tush!&ndash;&ndash;be
not ashamed lad. You yourself have heart for
the lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in a way unseemly,&rdquo; retorted the lad, dashing
the water from his eyes,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;to think of the mother
dead like that behind the bars is not a cheery thing!
As for the daughter&ndash;&ndash;I dare call myself her foster
brother, and I dare pray for her that she finds the
chance to die in the open!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a little world it is!&rdquo; said the adventurer.
&ldquo;Do you mean that you did come with a message&ndash;&ndash;and
that your heart failed you as to consequences?
You failed the lady&ndash;&ndash;my unknown lady of the
tryst?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency:&ndash;&ndash;the maid thought you a person of
adventure, and she dared hope to buy your services&ndash;&ndash;then&ndash;&ndash;you
two know best what you whispered in
the dark!&ndash;&ndash;but she no longer thought of purchase
money in exchange for helping her escape to a ship;&ndash;&ndash;God
knows what she thought of, for you must not
forget that she is called mad, Se&ntilde;or! But with all
her madness she would not have approached your
highness with the same freedom had she dreamed
that your rank was high as the camp whispered to
me the day I came for speech with you! That rank
told me a story I could not go back and tell her,
Se&ntilde;or&ndash;&ndash;so&ndash;&ndash;I used my forged letter written on
viceregal paper, and secured service with a man instead
of a maid.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And left her waiting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could do her no help by going back&ndash;&ndash;she is
no worse off than if I had not come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sent you for the silken broidery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said if you could come to her service, the
scarf or a certain page of a certain book would serve
as a sign:&ndash;&ndash;letters are difficult things&ndash;&ndash;boys who
carry them are tripped up at times and learn the
might of a lash. To send a jewelled bauble and ask
for the silken scarf was a less harmful thing for the
messengers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You imp of an Indian devil! a souvenir was
sent me&ndash;&ndash;and a message&ndash;&ndash;and I am hearing no
word of it until now in this pagan land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency:&ndash;&ndash;the message is of little moment
now&ndash;&ndash;it was only a matter of a tryst&ndash;&ndash;and you
were too far on the journey! But the ardor of the
Capitan Gonzalvo may bring us all strange moments,&ndash;&ndash;and
it may be some graves! If mine should be
among them, and you should live to go back, you can
take from my neck the bauble trusted to me by the
lady. It is one of the records of her madness. But
you will not quite laugh at it, Se&ntilde;or&ndash;&ndash;and you will
forgive me that I could not give it to you as she had
dreamed in her madness that I could easily do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mad? By our Lady!&ndash;&ndash;there has been no madness
from first to last but my own when I was tricked
away from her by lies pious and politic! Oh&ndash;&ndash;oh!&ndash;&ndash;our
padre was in it deep, and I have served their
purpose! And you&ndash;&ndash;you girl-faced little devil&ndash;&ndash;what
share is yours in all this? Whose tool have
you been from first to last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the lad had regained his careless
mien&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;surely not that of Dame Venus or her son,
Master Cupid! It is well for me to find employ in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
the wilderness&ndash;&ndash;never again dare I seek service with
lord or lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your lady lost her wits ere she made you ambassador
on a love quest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without doubt you speak truth, Excellency. I
might add&ndash;&ndash;(had I not been whipped into politeness
to my superiors!) that the deluded maid had lost her
wits ere she fell into love with a face seen from a
balcony&ndash;&ndash;or with a voice whispering to her in the
darkness of a rose bower!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ruy looked at him without much of sweetness
in the glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve two minds regarding you,&rdquo; he stated,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and
one of them is to thresh you for faithlessness
and a forward tongue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I beg that you choose the other mind!&rdquo;
said the secretary, on his feet, alert, and ready to
make a run if need be. &ldquo;Don Diego could not well
spare me in the midst of his struggles with the
heathen, and his desire that honest things be set down
in the &lsquo;Relaciones.&rsquo; Moreover&ndash;&ndash;Excellency, it
would take many words to convince that pious gentleman
that I had been faithless in aught&ndash;&ndash;to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pitiful little quaver in the last words
by which Don Ruy was made ashamed of his threat,
for despite his anger that the lad was over close in
the confidence of the unknown Mexican maid, yet the
stripling had been a source of joy as they rode side
by side over the desert reaches, and he knew that
only for him had those Indian thoughts been given
that were heresy most rank for any other ears. In
ways numberless had the devotion of the lad been
manifest.</p>

<p>But Don Ruy had little heart to discuss the matter,
he was still flushed with the annoying thought that
the young cub had been let know every whisper of
the moment under the roses. He walked away without
more words.</p>
<p>And Yahn who was watching the two, was very
glad in her heart. She could plainly see that those
two who had laughed at her sometimes, were having a
quarrel that was a trouble to each, for Don Ruy
walked away with an angry frown, and the page stood
by the terrace steps a long time, and looked across
the river with no smile on his face.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE COURIER AND THE MAID</h3>
</div>
<p>Ere the morning star saw its face in the sacred
lake of the Na-im-be mountains, Tahn-t&eacute;,
the Po-Ahtun-ho, had done a thing not of
custom:&ndash;&ndash;he was leaving the governor to hear
the prayers of Povi-whah, while he, for reasons
politic, made the run to the most northern of pueblos.</p>
<p>Much in the council of the strangers had shown
him their power over the old men whose minds were
divided between dread of the savage tribes, and wonder
if the youth of Tahn-t&eacute; gave him warrant for all
the knowledge expressed by him.</p>
<p>The governor of Te-gat-ha had sent no men to the
council of Povi-whah. From that fact had Tahn-t&eacute;
reasoned that Te-gat-ha meant to show no favors to
the white strangers. Te-gat-ha was of itself, very
strong, else it could not have held its walls against
the Yutah and the wild tribes of the north. Therefore
would Te-gat-ha be a good comrade.</p>
<p>Twenty leagues it lay across the river and the
mountain, but Tahn-t&eacute; had ere the dawn taken the
bath in the living stream of the river:&ndash;&ndash;it runs and
never tires, and its virtues are borrowed by the bather
who lets it have its way with him while he whispers the
prayers of the stars of the morning.</p>
<p>He knew that this was the moon and the time of
the moon, when the summer ceremonies were made in
Te-gat-ha to the God of Creations, and because of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
a wonderful visitor in the sky, he knew that special
ceremonies would be held. The Ancient Star was
near the zenith&ndash;&ndash;never must it depart without a life
to strengthen it on the downward trail!</p>
<p>The Po-Ahtun-ho in his ceremonial person never
leaves the region of the sanctuary, any more than the
pope across the seas dare go adventuring. It was
as Tahn-t&eacute; the courier, that he carried the message
of the Po-Athun to the man of Te-gat-ha that no
shadow of doubt be left in his mind as to where they
stood in the Pueblo brotherhood.</p>
<p>The mountain forest of Te-gat-ha, and the rose
thickets close to the brown walls make it a place of
beauty. Through the open court between the century
old buildings, runs the mountain stream with
its message from the heights to the hidden river cutting
deep down in the green plain to the west.</p>
<p>The valley of Povi-whah was beautiful in itself
as a garden is good to look on when the spirits of
the Growing Things have worked well with the man
who covers the seed, but Te-gat-ha brought thoughts
of a different beauty&ndash;&ndash;even as did the memory of
W&aacute;lpi in Tusayan.</p>
<p>W&aacute;lpi breathed the spirit of a tragic life, the last
fortress of a mysterious people. Te-gat-ha sat enthroned
facing the setting sun. Ancient, beautiful
and insolent&ndash;&ndash;with the insolence which refused to
grow old though she had been mistress of many
centuries.</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; the dreamer,&ndash;&ndash;the student of mystic
things, was subtly conscious of that almost personal&ndash;&ndash;almost
feminine appeal of Te-gat-ha. Strong in
its beauty as in its battles&ndash;&ndash;it yet retained a sensuous
atmosphere that was as the mingling of rose
bloom and wild plum blossom, of crushed mint grown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
in the shadows of the moist places, and clinging
feathery clematis, binding by its tendrils green thickets
into walls impregnable.</p>
<p>He could hear the beating of the tomb&eacute; while yet
out of sight of the sentinel on the western wall of the
terrace. Medicine was being made, or dances were
being danced.</p>
<p>While he ran through the forest his thoughts had
drifted again and again to the vision of the bluebird
maid. Was she the earth form of the God-Maid
on the south mesa where the great star hung low?
Was she the Goddess Estsan-atlehi who wore for
him the color of the blue earth jewel sacred to her?&ndash;&ndash;was
she the shadow of the dream-maid of all his
boy days&ndash;&ndash;the K[=a]-ye-povi who had gone from earth
to the Light beyond the light? All the wild places
spoke of her, each stream he crossed made him see
the young limbs pictured in the pool&ndash;&ndash;each bird
song made him remember the symbol sent to him by
the vision&ndash;&ndash;the world was a sweeter place because
of the vision.</p>
<p>It came even against his will between himself and
the priest of the robe who had called him &ldquo;Sorcerer&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and
who was the real general he would have to
do battle with in the near days. The others he
scarcely thought of, but that one of the wise tactful
speech he must think of much.</p>
<p>Then while he told himself that the thought of the
men of iron must never be forgotten for even the
sweetest of forest dreams;&ndash;&ndash;in that same moment
the rustling of the wind in the pi&ntilde;ons made him
thrill with the closeness of the remembered vision as
no sight of living maid had ever made him thrill:&ndash;&ndash;might
it be magic from Those Above to try his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
strength? Might the memory of the maid and the
pool, be akin to that temptation of the babe and the
arms of the mother outlined on the shadows of the
ancient graven stone?</p>
<p>That had plainly been false enchantment&ndash;&ndash;and
he had danced it away in the prayer dance to the
Ancient Father. It had not returned even in his
dreams. But the maid of the bluebird had not ever
gone quite away. So close she seemed at times that
if he turned his head quickly in the places of shadows
he felt that he might see her again before the Spirit
People hid the body of beauty.</p>
<p>And then&ndash;&ndash;as he ran, and turned where the trail
circled a rugged column of stone at the edge of the
pi&ntilde;on woods,&ndash;&ndash;there a shadow flitted as a bird past
the great gray barrier. He turned from the trail
almost without volition of his own, and followed the
flitting shadow, and&ndash;&ndash;the maid of the bluebird wing
was again before him!</p>
<p>Not merging into the shadows as before. Against
the grey wall of rock she stood as a wild hunted thing
at bay&ndash;&ndash;breathless, panting&ndash;&ndash;but with head thrown
back to look death in the face.</p>
<p>But death was not what she saw in his eyes&ndash;&ndash;only
a wonder great as her own&ndash;&ndash;and with the wonder
fear,&ndash;&ndash;and something else than fear.</p>
<p>Plainly she had been bound by thongs of rawhide,
for one yet hung from her wrist. Much of her body
was bare, her greatest garment was a deerskin robe
held in her hand as she ran.</p>
<p>Because of this, could he see that her body and her
arms were decorated with ceremonial symbols in the
sacred colors, and the painting of them was not complete.
It was evident she had been chosen for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
forest dance of the maidens who were young. It was
plain also that she had resisted, and had in some way
broken from the people.</p>
<p>At the something other than fear in his eyes, she
gained courage, and at the bluebird&rsquo;s wing in his head
band, she stared and touched the one in her own
braids, and then touched her own breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doli (Blue Bird)&ndash;&ndash;me!&rdquo; she said appealingly.
&ldquo;Navahu&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;then she held her hand out as though
measuring the height of a child.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Te-hua&ndash;&ndash;me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Te-hua!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he caught her hand and knew that
she was not a vision, though he had first known of
her in a vision. She was a living maid, and twice on
wilderness trails had she come to him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Te-hua&ndash;&ndash;you?&rdquo; he half whispered, but in Te-hua
words she could not answer him&ndash;&ndash;only begged
rapidly in Navahu for protection&ndash;&ndash;and motioned
with fear towards the villages where the tomb&eacute; was
sounding.</p>
<p>To give help to an escaped captive of Te-gat-ha
while on the trail to ask friendship of Te-gat-ha, was
an act not known in Indian ethics&ndash;&ndash;but as when he
had been wakened by her in the ca&ntilde;on of the high
walls&ndash;&ndash;so it was now&ndash;&ndash;the outer world drifted
far, and the eyes of the girl&ndash;&ndash;pleading&ndash;&ndash;were the
only real things. In his hours on the trail through
the forest he had thought the ever-present picture
of her in his heart might be strange new magic for
his undoing, but to hear her tremulous girl voice:&ndash;&ndash;and
to see the broken thong, and the symbols of the
most primitive of tribal dances, drove into forgetfulness
the thought of all magic that was false magic.
The gods had sent the vision of her in the dawn of
the sacred mountain, that he&ndash;&ndash;Tahn-t&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;might
know her for his own when she crossed his trail for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
help. The Navahu goddess of the earth jewel had
surely sent her&ndash;&ndash;else why the pair of blue wings
between them? The symbolism of it was conclusive
to the Indian mind, and he reached out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;Little sister,&ndash;&ndash;come
you with me!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When the sentinel on the wall of Te-gat-ha sighted
a strange runner who ran to them, and ran with
swiftness, the word went to the governor, and he sent
his man of the right hand to the gate of the wall.</p>
<p>In times of feasts these two had met before the
days when the prayers were listened to by Tahn-t&eacute;,
and the greeting given to the visitors was a greeting
to a friend.</p>
<p>As they crossed the court, Tahn-t&eacute; could see that
confusion and alarm was there. A woman who had
been chidden was weeping, and the governor of war
had his scouts at the place in the wall where the water
ran under the bridge of the great logs&ndash;&ndash;that was the
only place where one could creep through without
passing the gates, where the sentinel could always see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a witch!&rdquo; wailed the woman who was in
tears&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;The painting was being done on her,&ndash;&ndash;she
would have been complete&ndash;&ndash;and then it was the pot
boiled over in the ashes:&ndash;&ndash;they blinded my eyes, and
the child was in the ashes also, and the body of him
was burned. Could I see the witch when my eyes
were blind? Could I hear the witch when my child
screamed? Could I know she would cover herself
with a deer skin and go into the ground, or into the
clouds? On no trail of earth can you find her. She
is a witch who brings bad luck to my house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the men, heeding not her words, went over the
ground in ways towards the mountains, and looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
with keenness on all the tracks of women&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Beyond the words of the women, Tahn-t&eacute; heard
nothing more of the person who was painted almost
to completeness ere she went into the clouds, or into
the ground. It was not etiquette to make questions.
The wise old governor gave greeting to the visitor as
if no thing had happened more unusual than the rising
or setting of the sun.</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; had been many times to Te-gat-ha when
the Sun races were made in the Moon of Yellow
leaves. At that time the Sun Father grows weak, and
the races are made that he may look down and see
the earth children as they show strength, and the
prayer of the race is that the Sun Father goes not far
away, but seeks strength also, and grows warm again
after a season.</p>
<p>Thus Tahn-t&eacute; knew kindly the people, and the
chief men were called to hear why a runner had been
sent at this time to the brothers of the North.</p>
<p>The head men wrapped themselves in the robes of
ceremony, the younger priests painted their bodies
with the white, and into the kiva of council they descended
with their visitor of high office.</p>
<p>On the shrine there, Tahn-t&eacute; placed a fragment of
the sun symbol taken from the pouch at his girdle.
Before a white statue of the weeping god he placed
it, and the Keeper of the Sacred Fire there, breathed
on his hand, and threw fragrant dried herbs of magic
on the live coals, that all evil and all discord be
driven out by the fumes, and when the smoke drifted
upwards and out by the way of the sky, the talk was
made.</p>
<p>With briefness Tahn-t&eacute; stated all heard in the
council of Povi-whah concerning the wishes of the
strangers from the South.</p>

<p>The men smoked the sacred smoke of council and
listened, and when all was said, they nodded to each
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That which you say is that which the tribes have
always talked about when the wild people came for
war. In old days of our fathers, we people of the
houses and the fields did make compact with each
other as brothers. But always it has been broken,
often it had to be broken. We are far apart. When
the Yutah comes from the north, and the Pawnee
from the east&ndash;&ndash;and the Apache and the Navahu
from every place, the men of each village must
look to their own women. He cannot go to his
brother to learn if he also is having war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;. &ldquo;But the wild
people fight and go away again. If these strangers
find the symbol of the sun in our land, they will never
go away&ndash;&ndash;more will come&ndash;&ndash;and then more always!
I have seen the talking leaves of their people.
If they get room for their feet, they then ask the
field; if the way of the door is opened to them, they
then take the house. They and their animals will
ride us down as the buffalo tramp under foot the grass
on the wide lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That other year the white strangers came. They
staid not long. This time not so many come&ndash;&ndash;next
time not any ever come&ndash;&ndash;maybe so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so!&rdquo; echoed Tahn-t&eacute;, but shook his head
in sadness. Like the men of his own village, these
men had the hopefulness of children that all would
be made well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If their god is so strong a god&ndash;&ndash;and they come
with good gifts, is it not well to make treaty and have
them as brothers?&rdquo; asked the old governor. &ldquo;With
the thunder and the lightning given to them instead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
of arrows, they could do good warrior work for those
who were precious to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; agreed Tahn-t&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but the men of
dark skins will never be precious to the white men of
the beards&ndash;&ndash;except they make slaves who obey,&ndash;&ndash;who
carry the water, and bring wood for the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men carry the water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not men when they become slaves&ndash;&ndash;they
are not people any more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did not hear that,&rdquo; said the governor. &ldquo;Do
these men tell it that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;not in that way. But talking leaves of
their god tells them that dark men of other gods
than theirs must be ever as slaves to the white men of
iron and all of their kind. It has been like that always.
The talking leaves tell them how to make
slaves&ndash;&ndash;and how to make war on all people who refuse
to say that their god must be the only god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that white god sends talking leaves of a
spirit tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Many leaves! The
spirit of that tree was once a strong spirit, but the
white people caught it with magic and shut it in a
book, and the spirit grows weak in the book&ndash;&ndash;the
heart of the Most Mysterious cannot be shut in a
thing like that. They have magic, but the heart does
not sing to that magic&ndash;&ndash;only the eyes see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet these strangers are wise,&rdquo; ventured one of
the council, &ldquo;such leaves might be good to instruct
quickly the youth of the clans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; agreed Tahn-t&eacute; again. &ldquo;But when
the gods are caught in the leaves of a book, is when
they no longer speak in silence to the hearts of men.
On a day when we walk no more on the Earth Trail,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
the names of our gods may also be written on the
leaves of a spirit tree that is dead. Think of this
and warn your sons to think of this! The youths of
Povi-whah and of Kah-po hearken with joy to the
trumpets of the men of iron, but the music for the
desert gods is the music of the flute&ndash;&ndash;let it not be
silenced by trumpets of brass made by white men who
conquer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the men of the council looked at each
other, and wondered in their hearts if the youth of
Tahn-t&eacute; did not make him dream false things and
think them true. It was scarcely to be believed that
one people would fight because another people found
the Great Mystery&ndash;&ndash;and prayed to It for strength
to live well&ndash;&ndash;and to live long&ndash;&ndash;but called It by
another Prayer Name!</p>
<p>They knew that in things of sacred magic Tahn-t&eacute;
was more wise than any other;&ndash;&ndash;other youth were
trained only in their own societies&ndash;&ndash;but the son of
the Woman of the Twilight reached out for the
Thought back of the outer thought in all orders, and
in different tribes.</p>
<p>Yet&ndash;&ndash;they doubted him now and for the first
time! They did not think that Tahn-t&eacute; spoke with a
crooked tongue, but some one had lied to him in the
days when he crossed the land with the man Coronado;&ndash;&ndash;or
maybe the talking leaves had lied on some
dark night of magic!</p>
<p>But however that might be, the Great Mystery had
never sent the word to kill a people because of their
prayers. The men of the council knew that could
not be. But they were respectful to the young Po-Ahtun-ho,
and they did not say so. That he had put
aside his dignity of office, and come himself to Tegat-ha
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
for council, was a great honor for Te-gat-ha.</p>
<p>And they smoked in silence, and did not say the
thing they thought.</p>
<p>But Tahn-t&eacute; the Ruler, read their hearts in their
silence, and for the first time his own heart grew sick.
In Povi-whah there was the jealousy of the war
chief&ndash;&ndash;and of the governor as well, and that, he
thought, made them blind to much. But these men
had only honor in their hearts for him and no jealousy.
Yet to make them see motives of the strangers,
as he saw them, was not possible; and to tell them that
the men of iron gave worship to a jealous god was
to brand himself for always as foolish in their eyes!
They had thought him wise&ndash;&ndash;but not again could
they think him wise as to the foreign men, or the reading
of their books!</p>
<p>The early stars were alight in the sky when the men
came up from the council. In the house of the governor
the evening meal was long ready.</p>
<p>From the place of the dance in the forest, men and
maids were coming:&ndash;&ndash;under the branches of the
great trees they were coming, but among them was not
the maid of the thong and the unfinished paintings.
Tahn-t&eacute;, seeing that it was so, ate with his hosts the
rolls of paper-like bread, and the roasted meat of the
deer.</p>
<p>It was a silent meal, for it was his first day of
failure. All other things he had won&ndash;&ndash;but to win
his brothers to brotherhood against the strongest
enemy they or their fathers had ever met&ndash;&ndash;was a
thing beyond his strength.</p>
<p>They had chosen to be blind, and for the blind, no
one can see!</p>
<p>Standing on the terrace, the governor spoke alone
to Tahn-t&eacute; of the thing which the men of iron
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
sought&ndash;&ndash;it was the same thing Alvarado had asked of when
he had come north from Coronado&rsquo;s camp. It was
strange that the sign of the Sun Father was a thing
the white men sought ever to carry from the land.
It must be strong medicine and very precious to them!</p>
<p>It was not possible for Tahn-t&eacute; to make clear that
the virtue of the yellow metal was not a sacred thing&ndash;&ndash;only
a thing of barter as shell beads or robes might
be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it as they say,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;said his host after a smoke
of silence&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;is it as they say that the Order of the
Snake is again made strong by you in Povi-whah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;. &ldquo;The help I have is
not much. The Great Snake they all revere for the
sacred reasons, but only the very old men know that
with the Ancients the medicine of the wild brother
snakes was strong medicine for the hearts of men.
Maybe I can live long enough to teach the young men
that the strong medicine is yet ours, and that the wild
brother snake can always help us prove to the gods
that it is ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true that it is ours,&rdquo; assented the old man,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and
it is good when the visions come to show us
how it is ours,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;then after a little, he added:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;For
the sleep you will stay with my clan?&rdquo; but
Tahn-t&eacute;, standing on the terrace, shook his head and
pointed to the south.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks that you wish me,&rdquo; he said,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but the
work is there and the watching is there. When the
smoke is over&ndash;&ndash;I ask for your prayers and&ndash;&ndash;I
go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steadily he ran on the trail past the thickets of the
rose, and the great rock by the trail&ndash;&ndash;steadily under
the stars a long way. Then out of the many small
night sounds of the wilderness he heard behind him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
the long call of a night bird in flight. Only a little
ways did he go when again that little song of three
descending notes came to him. It was very close this
time, but he neither halted nor made more haste.
For all the heed given it he might not have hearkened
to it more than to the cricket in the grass.</p>
<p>Yet it spoke clearly to his ears. He knew that
sentinels had been placed along his trail, and as he
ran steadily, and alone, past each, he knew that the
watchers were keen of eye and ear, and that the last
two sent each other the signal &ldquo;All is well,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;also
he knew that the signal would be echoed back along
the trail until each watcher would know that their
visitor was on the trail alone, and all was well, and
each could go back to Te-gat-ha and report to the war
chief, and find sleep.</p>
<p>The watchfulness told him also that the maid they
sought was one of importance. The visitor in the
sky, called by his people the Ancient Star,&ndash;&ndash;and
called by Fray Luis the planet Venus, gave special
meaning to a captive from the tribe of an enemy. It
saved some clan from devoting a son or a daughter
to sacrifice.</p>
<p>He did not halt at once even after the last call was
sent back into the night, and he was far on the south
trail ere he turned and more slowly retraced his steps.
No lingering watcher must be overtaken by him on the
trail.</p>
<p>So it was that Arcturus (the watcher of the night
when the sun is away) was high overhead when he
came again to the place of the great rock where as
youths, he and his comrades climbed on each others&rsquo;
shoulders&ndash;&ndash;and even then only the most agile and
daring had scaled the smooth wall, and lay hidden
there in a water worn depression. Many scouts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
might pass it without thought that a maid could be
hidden there!</p>
<p>But the mere whisper of a whistle like the bluebird
call brought her head over the edge, and their eyes
met in the starlight.</p>
<p>Half the day, and half the night, had she lain there
waiting for his call, hearing more than once the pad
of the feet, or the panting breath of scouts:&ndash;&ndash;she had
even heard words of the sentinels sent from Te-gat-ha
ahead of Tahn-t&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;eager as wolves they were in
search of the maid&ndash;&ndash;for it was evil medicine most
potent to lose a captive after the symbols of ceremony
had been drawn on the body!</p>
<p>But all her fear of them gave her no fear of
Tahn-t&eacute;. His first look into her eyes had been the
look which said strange things, and sweet things&ndash;&ndash;it
was as if he had spoken thanks that he had found
her on the trail.</p>
<p>And when he held up his arm to her in the night,
she wrapped closely the deerskin robe about her, and
slipped downward into his embrace.</p>
<p>The wall was so high he had himself gone ahead
and dragged her up by help of the skin robe. And,
strong though he was, the weight of her as she slipped
downward against him staggered him, and his arms
went tightly around her slender girl&rsquo;s body to save
her, and to save himself.</p>
<p>And in that moment one of the magical things
came to pass in the starlight, her young breasts were
bare and held close to his own body. Her heart beats
were felt by him as she lay limp for a space in his
arms, and Tahn-t&eacute; knew that for all other things in
his life words could be found&ndash;&ndash;but for the thrill of
the touch of her body there were no words. It was
as if a star had slipped out of the sky and given its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
glow and radiance to his life&ndash;&ndash;the music of existence
had touched him&ndash;&ndash;and the magic of it held him
dumb and still.</p>
<p>And he knew that the magic of the maid was born
of the Great Mystery, and that a new life for him
was born as each heard the heart beats of the other.</p>
<p>It was as truly a new marking for the Life Trail
as had been the prayer made as a boy at the mesa
shrine to answer the young moon message of the God
of the Wilderness.</p>
<p>The maid stirred in his clasp and drew herself
shyly away from him. At her first little movement,
his arms grew tense about her, then they fell away,
and he watched her, while with head averted from
him, she arranged as well as might be her scant garb.
There could be no words between them, but his touch
was tender as he took her hand and led her out to the
trail. He felt that she must know all he felt&ndash;&ndash;and
all the dreams into which the white shadow of her
had entered&ndash;&ndash;the sacred fourth shadow cast not by
the body, but by the spirit, and linking itself with
kindred spirit even while the human body breathed
and moved and cast the black first shadow that all
people may see.</p>
<p>The black first shadow all can see as a man moves
or as he stands still, and the two gray shadows many
can see after a man is on the death trail or when the
breath has gone away. These remain with a man
because they are of his body, but the white shadow
is the shadow of the breath of the Great Mystery&ndash;&ndash;it
is as the perfume of the flower, the song of the
bird, and the love of the man.</p>
<p>Fear lent the girl fleetness as she ran beside him in
the night, and he marvelled at her.&ndash;&ndash;No pueblo girl
could have kept that pace. It was plain that she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
lived with the rovers of the desert. All the long
hours had she been without food or drink, yet she ran
like a boy, and with the swiftness of a boy.</p>
<p>When the dawn broke, and the morning star
showed each the face of the other, they had reached
the trail by the river. From the west came black
wind-swept clouds to meet the sun, and in the south
the angered God of Thunder spoke. Tahn-t&eacute; looked
at the girl whose eyes showed the weariness of the
long strain&ndash;&ndash;his thoughts dwelt on the woes she must
have lived through ere he found her:&ndash;&ndash;plainly she
could not run unfed to the hills of his people, and
plainly since the storm was meeting them, the wise
time to halt must be ere it swept the valley.</p>
<p>From the well known trail he had departed before
the dawn, and the way they went was a hard way
across the heights where earth&rsquo;s heart-fires had
split the land and left great jagged monuments of
stone;&ndash;&ndash;and red ash as if even now scarcely free from
the heat of flame.</p>
<p>Into one of the great crevices,&ndash;&ndash;wide, and roofed
by rock&ndash;&ndash;he led the strange maid. Water came
from a break in the great grey wall, and sand had
drifted there on the wind, and the girl with a moan
that was of weariness sank down there where the sand
was. Tahn-t&eacute; felt himself strangely hurt by that
moan and wondered that it should be so.</p>
<p>She was only a maid after all, and the little woeful
cry made him think of a hurt child he would have
lifted in his arms and carried home to its mother.
But the maid of the bluebird wing was far from
mother and from her people;&ndash;&ndash;no words had they
exchanged in the long trail of the night, he knew
not anything but that she spoke Navahu, and would
have him think she wished to be Te-hua.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>When she lay so very still that he could not see even
the sign of life in her face, he went close and touched
her&ndash;&ndash;and then he saw that the spirit of her had truly
gone on the trail of the twilight&ndash;&ndash;she was no longer
alive as other people are alive.</p>
<p>He lifted her to where the water ran, and with
prayer let the cool drops of the living spring touch
her face until the life came back, and her eyes opened
wide with terror at sight of him bending above her,
but he whispered as to a child&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Na-vin (my own)&rdquo;
and then &ldquo;K[=a]-ye-povi&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;which was to call her the
Blossom of the Spirit, the name had been always with
him in the Love-maiden Dream;&ndash;&ndash;and this maid
was the dream come true!</p>
<p>He drew her back from that strange border land of
life where the strong gods of shadow wait;&ndash;&ndash;and
then the whisper of the blossom name took the fear
from her dazed eyes&ndash;&ndash;she clung to his hands and in
a sort of breathless joy repeated the name &ldquo;K[=a]-ye-povi&ndash;&ndash;K[=a]-ye-povi!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Me!
&ldquo;K[=a]-ye-povi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&ndash;&ndash;Doli&ndash;&ndash;Navahu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded assent. &ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;it is so&ndash;&ndash;now,&rdquo;
she said&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but once when little,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she made the
sign for the height of a child&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Te-hua, not Navahu&ndash;&ndash;then
K[=a]-ye-povi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus it was Tahn-t&eacute; found K[=a]-ye-povi after the
many years, and knew that the Great Mystery had set
his foot on the trail to Te-gat-ha that he, and not
another, should find her!</p>
<p>From traders, and from an occasional Navahu
prisoner, Tahn-t&eacute; had learned Navahu words, and
Navahu god thoughts, and now he strove with eagerness
to speak their language, even though haltingly,
and question of her coming to him&ndash;&ndash;to him!</p>
<p>To a new master she had been sold by the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
people who had owned her long, and many of the
Navahu had gone north for deer&ndash;&ndash;and perhaps for
buffalo, and she had been taken with them. So far
had they travelled that Tse-c[=o]me-u-pi&ntilde;, the sacred,
had been pointed out to her&ndash;&ndash;and as a bird will seek
its own place of nesting, had she sought the Te-hua
land by fleeing to the sacred mountain. In the night
time she had fled from her new master,&ndash;&ndash;from a tall
pine where she had climbed, had she seen them search
the trail for her. In vain they had searched, and alone
she had wandered many days. Almost had she
reached the Te-hua towns of the river when some
traders of Te-gat-ha had found her in the forest.
To their own town they had taken her and had traded
her for shell beads and for corn&ndash;&ndash;the rest Tahn-t&eacute;
knew!</p>
<p>He strung his bow while he listened,&ndash;&ndash;and while
the thunder shook the earth he slipped through the
crevices of the rock and lay hidden at the edge of a
mountain morass where the reeds grew tall, and wild
things fed&ndash;&ndash;ahead of the storm small animals might
cross the open there to reach the shelter of the rock
walls&ndash;&ndash;and K[=a]-ye-povi must not go unfed.</p>
<p>A rabbit he killed and covered each track of his feet
from the place where he picked it up. When he took
it to her it had been cleaned and washed in a little
cascade below the shelter he had found for her.
With him he took also dry twigs and dry pi&ntilde;on
boughs, that the fire made might not carry the odor of
green wood.</p>
<p>The sheets of rain were flowing steadily towards
them from the west, the earth trembled as the God of
Thunder spoke, and the lances of fire were flung from
the far sky and splintered on the rocks of the mountain.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>The maid lay, wide eyed and still, where he had
left her. That she feared was plain to be seen, and
at his coming tears of gladness shone in her eyes.</p>
<p>To see that light in her face as he came back to
her brought to him a joy that was new and sweet.
He did not speak to her. He made the fire in silence,
but at every crash of the storm he smiled at her, and
made prayers, and threw sacred white pollen to the
four ways, and the feeling that he was as guardian to
the maid whose very name had been a part of his boy
dreams, was a sweet thought.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful thing that out of the dreams
she had grown real, and had covered the trails until
she had reached him! It was sweet that his hand
had touched her and told him that the maid was a real
maid of pulsing heart and tremulous breath.</p>
<p>But with all the sweetness of it, there was a strange
thought fluttering over his mind like a moth or a
butterfly. It did not find lodgment there, but it did
not go quite away, and ere he offered to her the meat
roasted in the red coals of the pi&ntilde;on wood, he scattered
prayer pollen between them as on a shrine.</p>
<p>The line of the white between them was as the
threshold of a door over which a man may not step.
No man crosses threshold of another if the wife of
that man is alone there,&ndash;&ndash;and no brother goes into
the house where his sister is without other companion.
This was the law from the time of the ancient days,
and belongs to many tribes.</p>
<p>To the Navahu it did not belong, and the maid
knew only that the white pollen meant prayer, and
that she was circled by sacred things, and by thought
so sweet that her eyes rested on the sands when he
gazed at her.</p>
<p>So sweet did the thought grow that they no longer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
tried to speak as at first, and compare words Navahu,
and words Te-hua;&ndash;&ndash;her own forgotten tongue.</p>
<p>To whisper &ldquo;K[=a]-ye-povi&rdquo; was sweet, but to think
&ldquo;Doli&rdquo; was sweeter&ndash;&ndash;for it had been the vision
of the goddess of the blue he had first seen in the
pool of the hills;&ndash;&ndash;and to him had come her symbol
dancing on the ripples. He wore it in the banda
about his head;&ndash;&ndash;and he knew now that the image of
her would never grow faint in his heart. Out of the
hand of the Great Mystery had she come to him that
the last and best gift of life should be known, and that
the prayers to the gods be double strong because of
that knowing.</p>
<p>Without daring to look at her he sat in silence and
thought these things, and he felt that she must know
what the thoughts were. The war of the elements
was as a background for strange harmonies, and the
low roaring clouds of darkness were but a blanket of
mist under which the fire glow of two hearts be felt
to shine near and clear, and send to each its signal.</p>
<p>Then&ndash;&ndash;like a monster let loose, there were broken
all bonds of the tornado on the river hills. A blackness
as of night covered the earth with wide spread
wings. With the voice of thunder it came;&ndash;&ndash;and
with the strength of a god it came.</p>
<p>Earth and stone were hurled on the wind as if a
rain of arrows or spears had been hurled by some
spirit of annihilation.</p>
<p>Even breath had to be fought for there,&ndash;&ndash;and the
maid in terror reached out her hands to the man
across the sacred barrier and moaned pitifully, and
in the darkness the man drew her close until her head
rested on his breast, and his own bent head, and his
body, sheltered her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE GIVING OF THE SUN SYMBOL</h3>
</div>
<p>Two nights had passed over the world, and
the day star was shining over the mountains
of the east when the people of Povi-whah
saw again Tahn-t&eacute; the Po-Ahtun-ho.</p>
<p>It was the sentinel on the terrace who saw him, and
he was at the ancient shrine at the mesa edge, and a
flame was there to show that prayers were being
made to greet the god of the new day.</p>
<p>And when he came down from the mesa, and
looked at the corn of the fields torn and beaten low
by the great storm, his face showed that he carried
a sad heart, and that he had gone from Te-gat-ha
somewhere into the hills for prayer.</p>
<p>And to his house went the old men, and they
listened to that which had been decided by the council
of Te-gat-ha. A man had already arrived from Te-gat-ha
to tell them that same thing, and to tell them
that an evil spirit of the forest who spoke as a Navahu
maid, had brought woe on the valley.</p>
<p>Some said it was the Ancient Star calling on the
voice of the wind for sacrifice, and others said the
tornado had come because the maid had been let go
with the sacred symbols of ceremony painted on her
body, and the gods of that ceremony called for her
on the wind. But whichever way was the true way,
the maid was linked to spirits of evil, and the corn
of that year would be less than half of a full year,
and the Te-gat-ha men asked that any Te-hua man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
who found the evil maid would send a runner to tell
of it. Robes and blue beads would be given for her:&ndash;&ndash;she
belonged to the god of the star, or the god of
the mad winds, and on the altar with prayers must she
be given to them, that they be not angry.</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; listened&ndash;&ndash;and when they said the anger
of the sky had come from the west, as the maid had
come, he was silent.</p>
<p>His first day of failure in council had been the day
when he shielded the Dream Maid on the trail.&ndash;&ndash;The
woman who had wept in Te-gat-ha had said she
was evil and a witch, and now the men pointed to the
killed corn as the work of her magic!</p>
<p>No word of his could undo these things or wipe
them from the Indian mind. In his own mind he
knew that a weakness had come upon him. To live
alone for the gods had been an easy thing to think
of in the other days, but now it was not easy, and his
heart trembled like a snared bird at each plan made
by the men for the undoing of the witchmaid if she
should be found.</p>
<p>The runner from Te-gat-ha looked strangely at
Tahn-t&eacute; as he walked across the court, and to Ka-yemo,
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You men of Povi-whah are good runners always,
and your Ruler of the Spirit Things has left you all
behind always in the race. Yet this time, to come
from Te-gat-ha, he stays two sleeps, and follows a
trail no man sees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the hills he has been for prayers&ndash;&ndash;so the old
men say,&rdquo; replied Ka-zemo. But Yahn, whose
ears were ever open, gave stew of rabbit to the Te-gat-ha
runner and asked many things, and learned
that the storm had washed away all tracks of feet, but
that the witch maid had certainly run to the south&ndash;&ndash;every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
other way was under the eyes of the sentinel
on the wall. By a little stream to the south had her
tracks been seen but not in any other place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tahn-t&eacute; crossed over the trail,&rdquo; said Yahn and
laughed. &ldquo;The priest of the men of iron say that
Tahn-t&eacute; is a sorcerer,&ndash;&ndash;who knows that he did not
bury owl-feathers or raven-feathers on the way to
hide her trail? If the witch maid was a maid of
beauty, is he not already a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man laughed with her, but he had heard of the
dance of Tahn-t&eacute; to the ancient stone god of the hills!
The man who danced there was not the man for the
cat scratches of Yahn the Apache, and though he
laughed with her because she was pretty and a woman,
he was not blind to her malice, and the meaning of
her words went by him on the wind.</p>
<p>But the thought once planted in the mind of Yahn
did not die. The face of Tahn-t&eacute; held a trouble
new and strange. He walked apart, and the old men
said he made many prayers that the Great Mystery
send a sign for the going of the white strangers.</p>
<p>In her heart Yahn thought as Tahn-t&eacute; thought.
The eyes of the man of the priest gown went like
arrows through her at times&ndash;&ndash;he looked like a man
who knew all things. To Ka-yemo he talked until
she was wild with desire to know the things said between
them. It angered her that Ka-yemo was flattered
by such attention. Padre Vicente she hated for
his keen eyes and his plain speech of her. Don Ruy
and the boyish secretary had too many moments of
laughter when her name was spoken of to Juan Gonzalvo&ndash;&ndash;as
it often was! Their gifts she took with
both hands, and did the talking for them as agreed,
but she sulked at times even under their compliments,
and Don Diego instructed S&auml;h-pah to strive that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
unruly beauty be brought within the Christian fold.</p>
<p>The success was not great, for S&auml;h-pah was brave
in a new gift of silver spurs&ndash;&ndash;worn on rawhide
about her neck, for it was the time of the Summer
dance when the women choose companions, and love
is very free. If the man prefers not to share the
love of the dame who makes choice of him&ndash;&ndash;he
makes her a gift&ndash;&ndash;or she chooses one.</p>
<p>The pious Don Diego had the secretary give many
lines in the &ldquo;Relaciones&rdquo; of this strange custom
where the fair fond ones offered marriage&ndash;&ndash;or accepted
a gift as memento. He even strutted a bit
that the poor heatheness offered to him what best she
could afford in exchange for the divine grace of a
good sprinkling of holy water. But Yahn said things
of the baptism not good for ears polite, or for the
&ldquo;Relaciones,&rdquo; and S&auml;h-pah scuttled back in fear to her
new master, and told him,&ndash;&ndash;and told Juan Gonzalvo,
that the veins of Yahn Tsyn-deh must be cut open to
let out the Apache blood, before they could hope she
might be one of the heaven birds in their angel flock!</p>
<p>But S&auml;h-pah did not tell them that the thing of
torment awaking Yahn to wrath had been the knowledge
that Ka-yemo was somewhere across the mesa,
and the old people laughed that he could not stay
longer from the new wife, but had gone to seek her
in the place of the old ruins.</p>
<p>After that, divine grace had not shielded S&auml;h-pah
from vituperation, and when Juan Gonzalvo came
wooing, Yahn told him that across the hills was a
woman waiting for a man, and dressed in fine skins
and many beads:&ndash;&ndash;when he or his men had won
Koh-p&eacute; the daughter of Tsa-fah, to come back and
tell her. She did not mean to be won easier than the
other, and without a price!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></div>
<p>Which was also a novel statement for the truthful
record of the adventurers, and the secretary, on a
terrace above, heard it, and rolled on the flat roof in
laughter, and wrote it down most conscientiously. By
such light matters was the dreariness of waiting days
lessened.</p>
<p>For plainly the days were to be of waiting. All
the good will of gift-bought friends helped the
strangers not at all to the finding of the trail of gold.
In the sands of the streams some fragments no larger
than seeds of the grass were found, and in the ca&ntilde;on
of Po-et-se some of the adventurers dug weary hours
in the strange soil where the traces are yet plain of
black ashes, and charred cinders far beneath the sagebrush
growth of to-day.</p>
<p>But while the Te-hua men gave good will for their
digging, yet more than that they could not give, for
the reason that no more than two persons could hold
in trust that secret of the Sun Father&rsquo;s symbol&ndash;&ndash;and
only certain members of the Po-Ahtun order knew
even the names of those two people.</p>
<p>After much patient delving had Ka-yemo learned
that this was so, for the thing was not a tribal matter,
but a thing of high medicine in the Po-Ahtun order.
Not even the governor knew who held the secret.
When the time came for certain religious ceremonies,
some of the yellow stone was placed on the shrine of
the weeping god with other prayers, but it was a
sacred thing, as was the pollen of the corn, and no
man asked from whence it came. To be told meant
that the person told was made guardian until the
death blankets wrapped him. It was a great honor.
No man could ask for it. A brother might not know
that his brother was the keeper of the trust. Only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
the head men of the secret order of Spirit Things
could know.</p>
<p>In vain Juan Gonzalvo swore, and Padre Vicente
used diplomacy and made wondrous fine impression
as the ambassador for the king of all Spain and the
Indian Island!</p>
<p>Don Ruy took the secretary and Yahn Tsyn-deh,
and went to the governor of Kah-po where his reception
was kindly, but the information given him
was slight.</p>
<p>That dignitary told him that his men of Mexico
might dig great caves if they chose in search for the
yellow metal of the sun symbol, but that to Povi-whah
had been given the secret of the gold at the time when
Se&ntilde;or Coronado had burned the two hundred men at
the stake in Tiguex. All the old men knew that gold
was the one thing the men of iron searched for. Before
that time all villages had men who knew where
it was hidden by the Sun Father. But a council of
head men had been called. It had been a great
council and long. At the end of it, one village was
chosen, one order of that village, and two members
of that order, and in the ears of those two alone was
whispered the hiding place. No man could know
who the two keepers of the secret might be, for it
had to do with sacred things and with strong magic,
and in that way did the villages decide to guard the
secret of the High Sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No chance here for whispers of courtiers and
king&rsquo;s counselors to get abroad in the land,&rdquo; decided
Don Ruy as they mounted their horses for the home
ride and Yahn lingered to gossip with neighbors.
&ldquo;In the south the conquerors could fight for gold and
win it&ndash;&ndash;but in this land of silence with whom is
one to fight?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Need you the gold so much that you must come
between these poor people and their god in the sky?&rdquo;
asked the secretary doubtfully, for the attitude of
the two had been of extreme politeness and not so
much of comradeship since that morning of confession
when the lad had owned himself a deficient page
in the bearing of love messages,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Is the finding of
the gold a matter of life or of death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It pays for most good things,&rdquo; stated Don Ruy.
&ldquo;How know you that I do not beggar myself on this
expedition? And to go back with empty hands
would win little of favor for me from even the well-guarded
Do&ntilde;a of the Mexic tryst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget, Excellency,&rdquo; said the lad and smiled,
&ldquo;she is called mad you know&ndash;&ndash;and to a mad maid
you might return in a cloak of woven grasses, or of
shredded bark, and lack nothing of welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Only to a mad maid dare I return
coatless, and find an open gate? And suppose it be
another than the gentle maniac whom I seek?&ndash;&ndash;a
cloak of grasses would be a sorry equipment to cover
my failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one right good blanket at your disposal,&rdquo;
said the lad looking straight out across the
river, yet feeling the color mount to his hair as Don
Ruy regarded him keenly and then clapped him on
the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll claim half of the blanket when the day
comes!&rdquo; he declared&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and in truth I&rsquo;d not be so
sorry to see the maid of your discourse whether mad
or of sanity. That ever restless Cacique who strives
to bar us out, shows me that more than one Indian
may have gone mad in the same struggle. Think you
he must know the keepers of the secret of gold?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It would not be strange, since he is the head of
the magicians and the worker of spirit things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God send that Juan Gonzalvo gets not that idea
strongly in his mind&ndash;&ndash;it would be the cap sheaf to
the stack of his grievances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it would be the one to weigh most heavily
with his reverence the padre&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;added Chico. &ldquo;His
soul is set on treasure for the Holy Brotherhood&ndash;&ndash;and
to win in secret where Coronado and the church
failed with all the blare of trumpets, means that no
man in the Indies would have a name written above
that of the patient and devout Padre Vicente.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say things, lad, with a serious face;&ndash;&ndash;but
with a mocking voice,&rdquo; commented Don Ruy.
&ldquo;Tell me truly if the life of a page in the palace
of the Viceroy teaches you so much of politics and
holy orders that you combine the two and grow
skeptic to each?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A page sees more than he understands&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; returned
the lad, &ldquo;it was the teaching of your mad
Do&ntilde;a of the silken scarf who saw things as the priests
told her they were not to be seen,&ndash;&ndash;she it was who
taught me to laugh instead of doing penance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she it was also no doubt who taught you of
magic Mexic things in keeping with the fairy Melissa
of Charlemagne&rsquo;s day, and Merlin the magian of
Britain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heigh-ho! It is precious magic those old romancers
did tell of!&rdquo; agreed the lad. &ldquo;Think how
fine it would be if we had those enchanted steeds and
lances,&ndash;&ndash;and the fair daughter of the Khan of Kathay
for company through the wilderness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was too fickle, and too much the weeping
fair,&rdquo; decided Don Ruy. &ldquo;Bradamante the warrior
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
maid is more to the fancy&ndash;&ndash;she would fight for the
lover she loved&ndash;&ndash;or against him as the case might
be, yet give love to him all the time! She was the
very pole-star of those old romances&ndash;&ndash;but they make
no such maids except in books!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much pity for that,&rdquo; commented the
secretary. &ldquo;Since she was too easily won for the
hearth stone of a plain man. It is clearly set down
that she spoke with her pagan lover but once, and
fell straightway so deep in love that she would fight
either Christian or Moor to find the way to him. A
maid like that looks well afar off, but it would take
a valiant man to house with her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How know you aught of how many times eyes
must meet&ndash;&ndash;or words be said ere love comes?&rdquo; demanded
Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Bantam that you are!&ndash;&ndash;Must
a man and a maid see summer and winter together
ere the priest has work to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas&ndash;&ndash;and saints guard us!&ndash;&ndash;we need not to
live long to see denial of that!&rdquo; said the secretary
and shrugged and smiled. &ldquo;But since a maid close
to my own house throws lilies to strange cavaliers,
it is not for me to make discourse of ladies light-of-love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light-of-love!&ndash;&ndash;Jack-a-napes! You know not
so much after all if you get that thought cross wise
in your skull! My &lsquo;Do&ntilde;a Bradamante&rsquo; (for as yet
neither you or the padre have given a name to her!)
the &lsquo;Do&ntilde;a Bradamante&rsquo; spoke no word the most rigid
duenna could have frowned down! If you are her
foster brother you might have gathered that much of
wisdom to yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;your Excellency&ndash;&ndash;she has never scattered
wisdom broadcast on any one of us! An elfish maid
who needed guard of both duenna and confessor:&ndash;&ndash;how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
was a mere friend to know that a love of a mad
moment would have made her a wonder of wisdom
and discretion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Don Ruy suggested that he go to the
devil and learn sense, and added that if the famous
magic steed, or ring of invisibility were to be found
in the desert regions of these Indian provinces, he
would use them for a peep into the palace of the
Viceroy, or the nunnery of the Do&ntilde;a of the Lily.
No ambassador would he trust. For himself he
would see how much or how little of madness was
back of the message of the blossom, or the guerdon
of the silken scarf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were indeed a worthy page I would make
a song of your enchanted&ndash;&ndash;or demented Do&ntilde;a, and
pipe it to you to the tomb&eacute; of the medicine workers
on the roofs,&rdquo; declared the lad in high glee that Don
Ruy again spoke with frankness to him.</p>
<p>But his excellency put aside the offer, content to
make his own songs when there was a maid to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dame Yahn Tsyn-deh might listen&ndash;&ndash;and even
make herself beautiful for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Dame Yahn is like enough to make trouble
without the singing of songs! Whether it is the
Indian war capitan, or our own, I know not as to the
favorite. But some game she is playing, and I doubt
if it is for Juan Gonzalvo, despite his gifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Padre Vicente and Jos&eacute; were walking apart under
a group of the white limbed cottonwoods, as the two
riders drew near the village. Their discourse was
earnest, and the voice of the padre was heard in decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is how it must be, Jos&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
have found the way,&ndash;&ndash;the gold is as good as ours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the faith!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;said Don Ruy swinging from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
the saddle to join them; &ldquo;if this be true let us fill
wallets and break camp for Mexico!&ndash;&ndash;there is a
gentle maniac over there with whom I would fain
hold hands once more&ndash;&ndash;this womanless paradise
pleases me little!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The padre regarded him with tolerance, and never
a blink of the eye to denote remembrance of any
gentle maniac in particular. Since the dame had
served a worthy purpose, forgotten was all the
episode!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well you know the good tidings of Jos&eacute;,&rdquo;
he said&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;though there is no hint that the gold is
piled in bars waiting for the lading. Speak, Jos&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a man of Ni-am-be,&rdquo; said Jos&eacute;. &ldquo;He
has been outcast for a reason. He lives alone, and
the fear of the alone is growing in him, for he is
old! He was one of the men who made medicine to
forget where the sign of the Sun Father hides in
the earth. But the medicine was not good medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not forget?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made a vow to the sky to forget, but the sky
did not listen and take the vow. He does not forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he will show the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be he will show the place. He asks me
if it is a good life to live with your people, also if
you would take him away when you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;&ndash;ho!&ndash;&ndash;he fears what would happen if he
was left behind after telling&ndash;&ndash;he fears they would
kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much of the to kill is he afraid. He was
a medicine man. He knows what the other medicine
men could do. He would wish for the to die many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
times and they would not let death come near to his
cave in the rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By their magic?&rdquo; asked Don Ruy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By their magic, Excellency. Of all the head men
is he afraid, but of Tahn-t&eacute; the Po-Ahtun-ho who has
the sight of the dark is he much afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sight of the dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so, some men are born into the world with
it. They know the thought of the other man,&ndash;&ndash;they
see the hidden things. Tahn-t&eacute; has the strong
medicine and the eyes to see. He is much afraid of
Tahn-t&eacute; the Ruler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see the power of these necromancers with
their satanic arts?&rdquo; said Padre Vicente. &ldquo;We
must make it plain to these people that such fear is
to be driven out only by the true church and the
power of its saints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we wait for the gold until we teach them all
that, the profit of this journey will be to our heirs
and not to ourselves,&rdquo; decided Don Ruy. &ldquo;Pay the
renegade for the secret he should have forgotten,
take him along with us, and convert him at your
leisure. In all good time, and with a larger guard of
men, you can come for the further conversion of the
tribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is wisdom in what you say,&rdquo; replied the
padre, &ldquo;for converts here will mean a waiting game.
But once let us take to Mexico the golden proof of
the wealth in this province and there will be eager
troops and churchmen in plenty to cross the deserts
and defend the faith. But for that devil-possessed
Po-Ahtun-ho the road to success would be shorter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not good luck to say things against the man
of strong magic,&rdquo; stated Jos&eacute;. &ldquo;Ka-yemo, the war
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
capitan would like if Tahn-t&eacute; had never come from
the land of the H&oacute;pit&ucirc;&ndash;&ndash;but Ka-yemo says no evil
words of Tahn-t&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;he knows that Tahn-t&eacute; has ears
to hear far off, and eyes to see in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you forget you are a Christian soul?&rdquo; demanded
the padre. &ldquo;The holy saints can kill the
evil powers even in the sons of Satan! Let me hear
no more of the &lsquo;eyes of the dark;&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;pagan trickery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; said no more, but it was easy to see that the
veneer of foreign ritual had made little impression
on the Indian mind. He feared all the devils of the
Christian hell, and most of the gods of the pagan
pantheon. A policy of propitiation towards all the
unseen powers is the wise and instinctive attitude of
the primitive mind. He slipped his prayer beads
through his fingers as taught for prayer, but to be
quite certain that evil be bribed to keep its distance,
he stealthily scattered prayer meal as he walked behind
the others, and Yahn who was coming behind
them, saw him, and laughed. She was glad of heart
to see that the Te-hua, after years of the white man&rsquo;s
religion, was still at heart, a devotee of the Sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says that Tahn-t&eacute; the Ruler has not the
strong magic,&rdquo; he said lowly to Yahn&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but no
one else says so in this land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yahn did not care to discuss the power of Tahn-t&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;it
was a bitter thing in her days.</p>
<p>And as the little group went on through the fragrant
sage and the yellow bloom, Tahn-t&eacute; himself
stood almost on their trail, but a little to one side
where a knoll was.</p>
<p>Still as a thing of stone he stood there. His hand
shaded his eyes while he gazed across the sage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
levels&ndash;&ndash;across the water of the river and to the yellow
and red sands beyond.</p>
<p>Even at their footsteps near, and their voices, he
made no sign and wavered not in his gaze. Don
Ruy glancing at him saw that his expression was
keen, yet incredulous. So strange was it that Don
Ruy instinctively turned in his saddle to see the thing
at which Tahn-t&eacute; looked and frowned.</p>
<p>At first he could see only the wavering lines of heat
across the level&ndash;&ndash;and then he saw the thing, and
with a word halted the others and pointed.</p>
<p>Out of the red and yellow sand and soft green
patches of the desert growth a group of men were
outlined against the low hills. Indians with lances
and with shields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a curious thing,&rdquo; said Don Ruy. &ldquo;They
walk this way yet their steps bring them not closer!
Is it a war party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yahn gave one look, drew her breath sharply, and
turned speechless to Tahn-t&eacute;. Jos&eacute; after a long look
crossed himself many times and gripped the sleeve
of the padre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Navahu!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he muttered, the terror of his ancient
first captors coming over him. &ldquo;Navahu to
battle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tahn-t&eacute; made a little gesture to reassure the
startled interpreter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not see men alive there,&rdquo; he said,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;these
are not men, but the shadows of men who will
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shadows?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the tones of the padre were contemptuous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spirit people of the shadows&ndash;&ndash;these things do
come to some eyes, some days, in our land,&rdquo; stated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
Tahn-t&eacute; quietly. &ldquo;This time you have also been
given to see that these things are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke the mirage of the armed men
faded in a whirl of sand caught up by a wandering
wind, and while the others still stared at the place
where it had been, Tahn-t&eacute; passed them and ran with
easy stride across the levels to Povi-whah.</p>
<p>The Spanish crossed themselves, and even Yahn
Tsyn-deh trembled. Tahn-t&eacute; had chosen to show the
men of iron that his medicine was strong to bring
visions, and what was most wonderful&ndash;&ndash;to bring
them before the eyes of other men!</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; was shaking with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All things he hears,&rdquo; he muttered&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;all things!
Under the trees we spoke words&ndash;&ndash;far off they
reached his ears! He waited to show us that his
eyes were for the dark or the day&ndash;&ndash;or&ndash;&ndash;the <i>dead</i>!
The spirit men were Navahu. Holy Father, he can
bring all the men who ever died to tramp us into the
sand! Holy Father, my heart is very sick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others were silent. All were awed, and
Padre Vicente was thinking what was most wise to
say. There were enough in the group for strong
witness that Tahn-t&eacute; had shown them a thing which
did not exist;&ndash;&ndash;only a sorcerer could call up men
out of the earth and send them away on the wind!</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the sorcery we had no part, my children,&rdquo; he
said at last. &ldquo;The man who raised those demons
fled, as you see, at the sign of the cross! To-morrow
morning we have a mass. It is well to walk in
prayer, when Satan works with his chosen helpers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ruy looked at him sharply&ndash;&ndash;for the mirage
could not be a thing of wonder for so travelled a man.
But his was not the task to correct eminence as to
natural or infernal agencies, and the effect on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
minds of the two interpreters might prove a thing of
grace!</p>
<p>Therefore he bent his head, and rode onward, and
smiled at the secretary, who was careful to ride close,
and showed none too much of courage at this glimpse
of the magic of the barbarian who clasped hands with
the gods&ndash;&ndash;or the demons!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dare be written in the &lsquo;Relaciones&rsquo; of a
thing like that?&rdquo; he queried.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;You smile, Excellency,
as if you carried a magic shield, or enchanted
sword lifted from pages of old romance, but what
think you Se&ntilde;or Brancadori will say to this thing of
wonder? It does not belong to the living world we
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it not get into your dreams,&rdquo; suggested Don
Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;or if you do, content yourself with the fancy
that I indeed bear a magic shield and am ever near
enough for you to hide behind it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so much a coward!&rdquo; retorted the lad,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;to
die for a good cause in any human way is not
a thing to fear&ndash;&ndash;but these magical works&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without doubt they do belong to the sorcery of
Satan,&rdquo; said Don Ruy soberly, yet with an eye on the
padre&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and yon supple racer is of course one of
his heirs. Stay you close to me, lad, and forget not
your orisons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached the camp, a herald was calling
to the people from the terraces. He was calling
for all the men to prepare for battle. In a vision
of the bright day had Tahn-t&eacute; seen the coming of the
Navahu. The medicine of Tahn-t&eacute; was strong.
Not at home would they wait for battle. To steal
women had the enemy taken the trail to the dwellings
of the Ancient ruins in the hills, and there must the
warriors prepare to meet them on the trail.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></div>
<p>The names of men were called as scouts, and the
response was quick, as one after another ran to the
kiva for orders, and then started on the run towards
mesa and forest.</p>
<p>Don Ruy looked after them with eyes perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the Cacique regard the mirage with earnestness?&rdquo;
he said to the padre who also watched and
listened. &ldquo;The man has a quick, good brain and
marvellous understandings,&ndash;&ndash;but to prepare for
battle because of a sun picture in the sand is scarce
what I looked for in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Padre Vicente smiled with his lips, and stroked his
beard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have yet to learn that the Indian magic
workers let no tricks go by to prove their greatness,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he
said. &ldquo;That wench and Jos&eacute; were witness
to the thing&ndash;&ndash;thus he must claim it as his own!
When the scouts find no Navahu warriors, be sure it
will be for the reason that the magic of the sorcerer
caused them to turn back in weakness on the trail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will but strengthen his power, if it be so,&rdquo;
agreed the younger man,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and how will you surmount
that fear of him, and win the renegade of
Ni-am-be to give the word we need?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Protection and a life of ease away from the
Indian magicians is a good bribe for an outcast,&ndash;&ndash;and
it may be that fortune plays into our hands. I could
wish that the Cacique would follow the scouts with
his mummeries and incantations. You see how they
have taught even Jos&eacute; the fear of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;I do see, and but for the story that in this
one village is held the gold secret, I should say to
move camp to some province where bookish caciques
hold no sway. How account you for the keen brain
of this wonder-worker? We have pampered and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
tutored numbskulls in Seville who know not even their
own creed so well as it is known by this heretic barbarian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without doubt it is the power of the Prince of
Darkness,&rdquo; and Padre Vicente gave the opinion with
all due force&ndash;&ndash;having in remembrance that scene
of the gift of the rosary in the kiva, and seeing
clearly that the Spanish adventurer had more than a
little of admiration for the unexpected daring of the
pagan.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Witchcraft and sorcery are of the Devil,
and both white men and savages do trade their souls
for evil knowledge. To strip him of his ill-gotten
power would be a work of grace for the Faith&ndash;&ndash;and
it is a thing for which each Christian should gladly
say many prayers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ruy well knew that these ardent words were
directed at his own luke-warmness in regard to the
young Ruler. Maestro Diego and Juan Gonzalvo
had distanced him in setting a good example to the
men of the guard!</p>
<p>A messenger from the kiva approached and spoke
to Yahn, and she came to the Spaniards with a message.</p>
<p>A council was in the kiva. It was about war if
war came. The Po-Ahtun-ho thought it was good
that one of the white visitors be asked to sit and
listen; Don Ruy was invited to be that one. The
man Jos&eacute; was to interpret.</p>
<p>Don Ruy speculated as to the cause of this courtesy.
The Ruler certainly did not desire the help of
the white men&ndash;&ndash;the message did not even say as
much. But it was plain that there were two parties
on that question, and Tahn-t&eacute; meant to show no fear
of his opponents. They would see he gave them fair
chances.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></div>
<p>So he went, and Jos&eacute; followed, and Yahn
watched them&ndash;&ndash;to her great, yet silent rage.</p>
<p>Ka-yemo only reached the village as the last scout
was started for the trail of the Po-et-se ca&ntilde;on.
Ka-yemo was the official for the war orders, yet the
orders had been given without speech with him!
Over his head had it been done, and his protest to the
governor, and to the old men in council brought him
little of pride or of comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the trail to see your wife you might have
died,&rdquo; said one of the old men,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;or on the way
coming home. How could we know? If you die
and we have to fight&ndash;&ndash;we have to fight without you.
Before you were born we fought without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not to see a wife!&rdquo; protested Ka-yemo.
&ldquo;I can stay away like other men. Some one has
talked crooked! I was on the mesa talking with the
guardians who make the arrow heads. To the far
away ones I talked. The women send word to them
that they are afraid. A ghost is at Pu-y&eacute;. All the
women but the Twilight Woman are much frightened.
They want men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the governor. &ldquo;The scouts are
already on the trail. If men are needed, each man
is ready and each spear is waiting. To the Po-Ahtun-ho
has been shown a vision of the enemy&ndash;&ndash;it
was not a time to wait for council.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ka-yemo&rsquo;s handsome face was still sulky. The
vision of Tahn-t&eacute; might have waited. He had come
down with a fine new story of a ghost seen in the
ruins of Pu-y&eacute;, and it was ignored because Tahn-t&eacute;
the Po-Athun-ho had found a vision!</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; entered not at all into the discussion of
the confiscated rights of Ka-yemo. Even of the
ghost frightening the women he asked no question.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
Many things of war were talked of if the Navahu
should come to steal women or corn, and the dusk of
the twilight crept after the vanished sun when Tahn-t&eacute;
turned at last to the war chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ka-yemo, with the men of iron you have spoken
much and often,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Do you know
who told them first that in Povi-whah was held the
secret of the yellow metal for which they search?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tongue of Ka-yemo became stiff as all sat silent
waiting for his answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The padre asked me,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he said at last,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the
padre always makes people speak&ndash;&ndash;I told the padre
that which I had heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight stir among the men, but
Tahn-t&eacute; quieted them with a glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The priest of the iron men has also been told one
other thing,&rdquo; he continued&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and it is well for you
all, brothers, that you hear this thing. Oh-we-tahnh,
the outcast of Ni-am-be, was a strong medicine man.
He used magic in a dark way for evil. His power
was taken from him. He was told by the council
to forget the secret of the sun symbol. Brothers, he
has not forgotten! He has come to the camp of the
men of iron. He eats their food:&ndash;&ndash;last night he
slept by their walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our brothers of Ni-am-be will not be glad with
us if we let this be,&rdquo; stated one man. &ldquo;The evil
magic must be outcast always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send some one and find the man,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;.
&ldquo;When the sun of to-morrow comes, all who listen
here may be on the war trail. It is not good to leave
a coyote loose to do harm when no one watches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a little while the outcast was brought into the
circle. He cringed with fear, and his eyes were restless
as those of a trapped wolf. The governor questioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
him as to his presence there, reminding him
that the council of Ni-am-be had granted him life
only if he take that life out of sight of his kind.
Why then did he come to Povi-whah and stay in the
camp of the strangers?</p>
<p>His only reply was that he would go now, and he
would go quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;not quickly,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;. &ldquo;You will
not go quickly any where ever again. I am looking
at you! I say so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stared at Tahn-t&eacute; like a bird that was
under a charm. All the others saw the steady gaze
of Tahn-t&eacute;, and saw also that the outcast began to
tremble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold out your hand,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;, and when
it was done, Tahn-t&eacute; took from his medicine pouch
some pieces of yellow gold. They were heavy, he
passed them around until all might see, then he put
the gold in the hand of the outcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your clan was a proud clan and good, and you
made them ashamed,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;. &ldquo;You had
strong medicine and you used it for evil until
your name must not be spoken by your brothers. To
these men of iron you would trade that which is not
yours: Without speech of council you would do this&ndash;&ndash;and
to do it would be traitor! Because your heart
wishes to give the sun symbol to these strangers, I
send you to them with what your hand can hold. To
the priest of the white god give it! Tell him I, the
Po-Ahtun-ho, send it, and no more than that will he
ever see here in Povi-whah. Tell him that the
weight of it makes your hand shake and your body
shake. Tell him that the sickness is now in your
blood, and when the day comes again your tongue
cannot make words to tell him things. Tell him if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
his men put you in the saddle, or carry you to the
hidden place of the Sun Father, that the light of your
eyes will go out on the trail! I am looking at you!&ndash;&ndash;and
you, who once had a name, and were a worker
of magic, know that I look on you with Power, and
that it will be as I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped and drew in the ashes of the place of
fire, the figure of a man with hand stretched out, then,
with a breath, he sent the ashes in a little cloud and
each line was obliterated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To destroy you would not be good,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he continued.
&ldquo;It is better that the boys and the young
men see the fate given to a traitor. My brothers,&ndash;&ndash;is
this well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well!&rdquo; said the men, but the voice of the
war chief was not loud, and his hands shook until
he clasped them together and held them steady.</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; looked around the circle as though undecided,
and then rested on Ka-yemo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak the words of the Castilian man, and
like to speak them,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;so it will be
well for you to make the words for this man who
carries to their priest the gift of the sun symbol.
Forget no thought of it&ndash;&ndash;for all the words have
meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this speech to Ka-yemo was in Castilian, and
was plainly said, and Ruy Sandoval knew then why
the courtesy of the council had been extended to him.</p>
<p>And the outcast, holding the nuggets in his trembling
outstretched hand shook so that he could not go
alone up the ladder to the world above.</p>
<p>Ka-yemo, with a still, strange face of fear, put
out his hand to help the outcast, who looked as if
Great King Death had called his name.</p>
<p>No more words were spoken, and the men in silence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
followed after. They had seen a thing of strong
medicine, and the Great Mystery had sent power
quickly. That palsy by which the man had been
touched had come with the swiftness of the wind
when it whirls the leaves of the cottonwood. They
all knew that the tongue would be dumb, and the
eyes would be blind in the given time if need be.</p>
<p>And Don Ruy like the others, was touched with
awe of the man who had wrought the thing. As he
went up the ladder he looked back at the Ruler who
sat still&ndash;&ndash;gazing into the ashes of the place of
sacred fire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE TRUE VISION</h3>
</div>
<p>The sentinels on the terrace who watched
the night in Povi-whah knew these were
nights when they did not watch alone. The
Po-Ahtun-ho was abroad in the night for prayer, and
when they made reports in the morning, they knew
that he had not waited for such reports ere being
wise as to each shining path of a bright spirit sent
earthward by the Great Mystery,&ndash;&ndash;or each shadow
passing over the Mother of the Starry Skirt, or the
nearness of the visiting Ancient Star to the constellations
on its trail to the twilight land of many days.</p>
<p>They knew he was watching the world overhead.
With the Pi&ntilde;-pe-y&eacute;, that mystic compass of the Milky
Way, was he balancing the fate of things as written
in the light of the Sky Mother whose starry skirt was
a garment to which departed souls cling. So many
are the souls of earth people that their trail makes
luminous the white way of the sky, and all the world,
and all the people, can of course be seen from that
height of the sky, and when a dart of heat lightning
sped earthward to the west, the sentinels cast prayer
meals and knew that Those Above were sending messages
to Tahn-t&eacute; who prayed as no other prayed.</p>
<p>And on the heights were his prayers, for ever it was
to the mesa and beyond that his trail led since the
mighty wrath of the wind by which the corn was
broken to earth. The darkness was often running
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
from the dawn ere he came downward from the hills
into the valley.</p>
<p>A scout, speeding eastward from the mountains
in the dawn saw him coming down from the ancient
place of the Reader of the Stars in Pu-y&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;the
sacred place where no other reader of the Sky Things
goes in the night. The Lost Others are known to
abide there, and mourn the barren field of the older
day.</p>
<p>At times strange magic circles the ancient dwellings
of the cliff. Before a storm, light flickers like fiery
butterflies above the fallen walls on the summit.</p>
<p>For this reason was it deemed holy, and for this
reason were the women of Shufinne much afraid when
the ghost of a woman was seen plainly there between
the edge of the cliff, and the silver disk of the moon.</p>
<p>The scout carried this word, and Tahn-t&eacute; who
had been seen coming from prayers there, listened,
but gave little heed;&ndash;&ndash;the women had seen shadows,
and the older men said they were only weary that the
men were so far across the mesas. Fire out of the
sky, or out of the earth, had often danced on those
heights, but no woman had been there in a ghost form
ever in the memory of men.</p>
<p>Much more were they intent to know of any trace
of warriors on the hills, but only smoke had been
seen far beyond the place of the boiling water of the
hill springs, and the smoke could easily be of Ua-lano
hunters. Other scouts were yet to come. They had
made longer runs. This man had been told to return
at dawn of the day.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>So the word went abroad, and in the Castilian
camp, Don Diego gave fervent thanks. He was none
too well pleased that to secure records for the
&ldquo;Relaciones&rdquo; it might be necessary to carry a spear
against the heathen. It had been plainly understood
in far off Mexico that the people to be visited were
not a hostile people. They were to be found waiting
for salvation, and with good gold to pay for it!</p>
<p>The offer of the padre to give aid in battle to their
Indian brethren, had been but a courteous pleasantry
when uttered. It was a different matter when scouts
were sent abroad by the pagan Ruler to seek trouble
and bring it home to all of them!</p>
<p>Trouble enough was he brewing by that gift to
the padre of the sacred sun symbol. The pariah
who brought it was under the curse medicine of
Tahn-t&eacute;. Before their eyes he sat dumb, and the
Castilians crossed themselves with dread as they
looked on him. He was the visible warning of a
doom awaiting any other who dared speak!</p>
<p>Not alone could he lift water to his own lips. The
trembling of his hand was now the trembling of his
entire body. By order of Tahn-t&eacute; he was to be taken
to one of the little cliff dwellings at the foot of the
mesa. Each seven suns, an old man and a group of
boys were to have the task of carrying to him food
and water, and each visit the boys were to be told by
the Ancient why the medicine had been put upon the
outcast. Thus all youth would know that the Great
Mystery sent power against traitors.</p>
<p>In vain Padre Vicente tried to scoff at the reality
of it, or the continuance of it. The men pointed to
the palsied man, and prayers were remembered by
many who were not pious. Indian witchcraft was
not to their liking!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paracelsus with his necromancy has done nothing
worse!&rdquo; declared Don Diego. &ldquo;This barbarian
priest lacks bowels in his devilish art! Had he not
sent the gift of gold, the aggravation would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
been less pointed. That insult from the heretic is
not to be endured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet the saints do give us strength for the endurance,
Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied the secretary, &ldquo;and Don
Ruy paces apart, and keeps key on his thoughts since
that council. Think you he fears magic of the Po-Ahtun-ho?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good thing were it true!&rdquo; decided Don Diego&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;overmuch
is he inclined to countenance their pagan
practices, and find likeness in their mummeries to
the mysteries of the Greek&ndash;&ndash;and even the Egyptian
of ancient days! The sorcerer has snared him with
that ungodly learning of books. But while we see it,
and know it, Chico my son, it is as well that the
thought enters not into the &lsquo;Relaciones.&rsquo; Don Ruy
in the desert is a good comrade, but his Excellency in
Madrid could nip any book in the bud&ndash;&ndash;even the
most stupendous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is so great in power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is&ndash;&ndash;but it is enough to know that he is the
darling of princes, and has not yet been ignored by
their sisters! That which he wants in Madrid comes
easily to his hand,&ndash;&ndash;and this wild adventuring is unprofitable
madness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unprofitable shall it remain,&rdquo; decided Padre
Vicente, who had walked near enough to hear their
converse, and whose interest was ever alert to further
knowledge of their patron.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Let the heathen sorcerer
send what insolent message he will, it does
not change the fact the gold has been put into our
hands. It is clear proof that the story of the Indian
mine was a story of truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange it is that the abhorred Teo the Greek
should have been the one to carry word of it out to
the world&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;mused Don Diego. &ldquo;Write down in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
the &lsquo;Relaciones,&rsquo; Chico, that the ways of the saints
are often wondrous peculiar in the selection of evil
instruments for pious works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Se&ntilde;or, and shall I write down also that the
piety has not, up to this date, made so much progress
as devout minds could have hoped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may do so,&rdquo; conceded Don Diego&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but
fail not to give the true reason. Had these poor stubborn
barbarians not sent their women away, the
padre would have won many souls for the faith ere
this. Women are the instruments through which religion
reaches men. Not until the women have been
frightened back to their homes can we hope for a
comforting harvest of souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one soul waiting to be gathered with
the harvest,&rdquo; said the lad, pointing to the outcast.
&ldquo;If Christian prayers could lift from his shaking
hands the pagan doom, it would not do more to make
converts here than wordy argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The governor and the head men approve of his
sentence because the man made camp here without the
word of council,&rdquo; stated Padre Vicente. &ldquo;It is not
well to meddle with their Pueblo laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yahn, who listened, saw the smile on Chico&rsquo;s
face, and wondered why the lad should be humorous
because the priest did not venture to measure saintly
prayers with heathen medicine!</p>
<p>Glad enough she was that it was so, and eager she
was that some one should tell to Ka-yemo that his
new friends had a weaker god than the god of the
Te-hua people,&ndash;&ndash;even the medicine of Tahn-t&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;the
medicine of one man&ndash;&ndash;made them respectful!</p>
<p>But her own lips were sealed between anger and
jealousy. Like a sullen figure of fate she had
brooded during the days of strange changes. Sullen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
also she listened to speech of sorcery, and speech of
war if war came.</p>
<p>To go to battle was the one way by which Ka-yemo
could dominate and make the men of iron see
there was another than Tahn-t&eacute; in Povi-whah. This
thing she thought of by day, and dreamed of in the
night.</p>
<p>She heard his name on the lips of the old women
and of S&auml;h-pah, again they talked of the day when
the father had been left behind by the warriors to
pull weeds in the corn!</p>
<p>Like a chained tigress she walked the terraces and
heard their laughter, but no word did she say. If
once their laughing words had been said to her, she
felt she would kill S&auml;h-pah!</p>
<p>And Ka-yemo gazed at her with burning eyes afar
off&ndash;&ndash;yet looked the other way if by chance they
passed each other in the court of the village. It was
true he started over the mesa to Shufinne where the
new wife waited with the other young women and
the girl children, but midway on the trail the thought
of Yahn and Juan Gonzalvo had come to him&ndash;&ndash;and
he had turned in his tracks, and the new wife of the
many robes, and wealth of shell beads, was not seen
by him.</p>
<p>Phen-tza the governor said hard words to him that
his actions made laughter,&ndash;&ndash;and that he went about
as in an angry dream, and that the warriors asked
who was to lead if the day vision of Tahn-t&eacute; proved
a true vision!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not see the vision of Tahn-t&eacute;,&rdquo; retorted
Ka-yemo&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the people to whom he made it clear of
sight, say it was across the river to the sunrise&ndash;&ndash;why
then does Tahn-t&eacute; ask for scouts running to the
sunset hills? That is new medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The council asked that thing while you were yet
on the mesa,&rdquo; said the governor patiently. &ldquo;The
people who saw the vision of Tahn-t&eacute; saw only the
spirit form of Navahu warriors,&rdquo; and the governor
puffed smoke from his pipe to the four ways to
propitiate the gods for the mention of those who belonged
in the spirit land. &ldquo;But before the vision
was carried away by magic of the wind, Tahn-t&eacute; saw
more than the others, he saw a dream mountain behind
them&ndash;&ndash;and cliffs and a mountain pass that is
known to his eyes. Through that pass they were coming,
and the pass is beyond the sacred mountain to
the land of the hunting ground of the sunset. By
that trail he knows they come&ndash;&ndash;or they will come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think the vision of Tahn-t&eacute; is clear, and his
medicine good!&rdquo; said Ka-yemo&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;But the men of
iron are wise also. They call him&ndash;&ndash;sorcerer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not yet the time to say it aloud,&rdquo; warned
the governor. &ldquo;This is a time of strange things,
and our eyes saw that which came to the outcast who
carried the sun symbol to the men of iron. The
medicine of the white men is strong, and they could
be good brothers in battle,&ndash;&ndash;but not yet has their
man of sacred medicine shown magic like that,&rdquo; and
he pointed to the outcast waiting and shaking in the
sunshine against the wall of the village.</p>
<p>Ka-yemo knew by these words that even his own
clan watched him closely&ndash;&ndash;Tahn-t&eacute; had made the
jealous hearts afraid.</p>
<p>Yahn saw him go alone to the river&rsquo;s edge, and sit
long alone; his handsome head was bent in thought
and to no one could the thought be told. From the
terrace Yahn watched. It was a time when the war
chief should call men and see that bows were strong,
and lances ready. It was not a time to walk apart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
and be unseen of the warriors. One man, who
fastened a scalp to his lance for good medicine, talked
with S&auml;h-pah, and the woman laughed and asked who
would pull weeds in the corn if all men went seeking
the Navahu!</p>
<p>When Yahn Tysn-deh heard that, she went down
from the terrace into her own dwelling, and made
prayers to her own gods of her Apache people.
With a blade of obsidian she made scars until the
blood dripped from her braceletted arms. To the
divinely created Woman Without Parents, she
chanted a song of prayer, and to the Twin Gods who
slew enemies, she let her blood drop by drop fall on
the sacred meal of the medicine bowl:&ndash;&ndash;all this
that one man be given power&ndash;&ndash;and all this that a
Te-hua clan be not ashamed in the sight of gods!</p>
<p>Through the words of her prayer she heard the
hurry of feet, and the shrill of voices, and past
her dwelling tramped men of iron clanging the metal
of their arms, and the voice of Chico was heard
calling her name at the door, telling her the scouts
had found the Navahu camp:&ndash;&ndash;to come quickly to
Don Diego. Tahn-t&eacute; had read aright the magic of
the vision of the sand and the sun!</p>
<p>And Yahn Tsyn-deh slipped shell ornaments over
the wounds on her arms, and went out to make words
for the Christians.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THINGS REVEALED ON THE HEIGHTS</h3>
</div>
<p>All the Castilians but Padre Vicente and
Don Diego went with the warriors to the
western heights. For reasons of his own,
the padre preferred the pueblo when freed of the
influence of Tahn-t&eacute;, and Don Diego preferred to
bear him company,&ndash;&ndash;a secretary could well look after
the records of warfare, if it came to warfare, though
for his own part he believed not any of the heathen
prophecy of the coming of warriors, and wondered
much that his eminence, the padre, showed patience
with their pagan mummeries. He assured the padre
that it would be a wrong against Holy Church to
grant the sacraments to the pagan Cacique until that
doom of the outcast had been revoked;&ndash;&ndash;To take
the power of high God for the managing of pueblo
matters was not a thing to grant absolution for!
And Padre Vicente, to quiet his anxiety on that score,
agreed that when the pagan Cacique came for absolution,
he should be reminded of his iniquity.</p>
<p>And while they settled this weighty matter, the
young Ruler who had prophesied, moved contrary
to custom, with the leaders across the high mesa, and
was followed by the Castilian horsemen, in their
shining coats of mail, and on a mule led by Gonzalvo
rode Yahn, unafraid, and with proud looks.</p>
<p>And ever her eyes rested on Ka-yemo who held his
place of chief, and chanted a war song, and was
so handsome a barbarian that Don Ruy made mention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
of it, and told the secretary that he was worth an entire
page of the &ldquo;Relaciones,&rdquo; even though not a thing
of war came in their trail.</p>
<p>The great white cliff of a thousand homes of the
past, filled the Castilian mind with wonder. Generations
had lived and died since the ghost city of
the other days had throbbed with life, still the stucco
of the walls was yet ivory white, and creamy yellow,
and it looked from the pine woods like a far reaching
castle of dreams.</p>
<p>It was nearing the sunset, and a windless heat
brooded over the heights where usually the pines
made whisperings, clouds of flame color hung above
the dark summits of the mountain, and the reflected
light turned the ghostly dwellings to a place of blood-tinged
mystery. More than one of the adventurers
crossed themselves. Don Ruy said it looked, in the
lurid glow, like a place of enchantment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are beautiful enchantments,&rdquo; said
Chico&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and this may be one of them! Think you
we might find walls pictured by Merlin the magian
if we but climb the steep? Magic that is beautiful
should not be hedged around by a mere ocean or
two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place of the ghost woman,&rdquo; stated
Yahn,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and Shufinne, where the women are afraid,
is beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within sight was Shufinne, and there the Castilians
had expected to camp. But among the older
Indians there had been talk&ndash;&ndash;and who can gauge the
heathen mind?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two camps will we make,&rdquo; they decided.
&ldquo;Here is most water for the animals and here our
white brothers can wait; at Shufinne will the Te-hua
guard be awake all the night, and give warning if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
the enemy comes,&ndash;&ndash;other guards will watch the trail
of the ca&ntilde;on. Thus we cover much ground,&ndash;&ndash;no
one can pass to the villages of the river;&ndash;&ndash;and
quickly can all camps help the one where the enemy
comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so bad is the generalship in spreading their
net,&rdquo; said Don Ruy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor in excluding the stranger from the hiding
place of their pretty maids,&rdquo; added Chico with amusement.
&ldquo;Ysobel&ndash;&ndash;ride you close to me. This is
the place where they herd their women, and guard
them,&ndash;&ndash;and you are not so ill favored in many ways
as some I have seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ysobel whimpered that it was not to follow war
she had left Mexico and her own people, and like
Don Diego she could see no good reason to search
for trouble in the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not stay behind safe walls with the
padre?&rdquo; asked Don Ruy, and Ysobel went dumb
and looked at Chico&ndash;&ndash;and the lad shrugged and
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she not married a man?&rdquo; he queried, &ldquo;and
does not the boy Cupid make women do things most
wondrous strange in every land? Jos&eacute; would fare
as well without her watchful eye, but no power could
make her think it,&ndash;&ndash;so come she would on a lop-eared
mule despite all my fine logic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;yourself&ndash;&ndash;would come!&rdquo; retorted
Ysobel, &ldquo;so what&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Chico prodded the mule so that it went frisky
and sent its heels in the air, and but for Don Ruy
the beast might have left the woman on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What imp possesses you to do mischief to the
dame?&rdquo; he demanded&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and why laugh that she
follows her husband? When you have more years
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
you may perhaps learn what devotion may mean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never do I intend to strive for more knowledge
of it than I possess at this moment!&rdquo; declared
Chico&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;see to what straits it has led that poor
girl, who, but for this matter of a man, would have
been good and safe working in a convent garden.
Small profit this marriage business is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A selfish Jack-a-napes might you be called,&rdquo;
remarked Don Ruy, &ldquo;and much I wonder that the
woman bears patiently your quips. Give us ten more
years, and we&rsquo;ll see you mated and well paid for
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten years!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and the lad whistled,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;let me
wait ten of my years and I can wait the rest of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name of the devil!&rdquo; laughed Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;if
you grow impatient for a mate, we&rsquo;ll charge yon
citadel and capture one for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my patience can keep step with your own
will, Excellency,&rdquo; retorted the lad. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no fancy
for halting the expedition, or of making a winning
through another man&rsquo;s arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your conceit of yourself is quite up to your
inches,&rdquo; observed his patron. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve had a
few floutings you&rsquo;ll be glad to send signals for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One flouting would be enough to my fancy&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d
straightway borrow myself a monk&rsquo;s robe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all think that with the first love affair&ndash;&ndash;or
even the second&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; volunteered Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but
after that, philosophy grows apace, and we are willing
to eat, drink&ndash;&ndash;and remain mortal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ysobel giggled most unseemly, and Chico stared
disapproval at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why laugh since you know not anything of such
philosophy, Dame Ysobel?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It is not
given many to gather experience, and philosophies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
such as come easily to the call of his Excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman hung her head at the reproof, and his
Excellency lifted brows and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have betimes a fine lordling&rsquo;s air with you,&rdquo;
he observed. &ldquo;Why chide a woman for a smile
when women are none too plentiful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they had reached the place of the camp, and
the secretary swung from the saddle in silence. Don
Ruy watching him, decided that the Castilian grandfather
must have been of rank, and the Indian grandmother
at least a princess. Even in a servant who
was a friend would the lad brook nothing of the
familiar.</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; stood apart from the Spanish troop while
camp was being made, and a well dug deeper in a
ravine where once the water had rippled clear above
the sand. The choice of camp had not been his.
The old men and the warriors had held up hands,
and the men of iron were not to see the women at
Shufinne,&ndash;&ndash;so it had been voted.</p>
<p>The lurid glow of the sky was overcast and haste
was needed ere the night and perhaps the storm,
came. Since it was voted that Pu-y&eacute; be the shelter,
Tahn-t&eacute; exacted that only the north dwellings be
used&ndash;&ndash;the more sacred places were not to be peered
into by strange eyes!</p>
<p>A Te-hua guard was stationed at the ancient
dwelling of the Po-Ahtun. Near there alien feet
must not pass. Where the ruins of ancient walls
reached from edge to edge of the mesa&rsquo;s summit, there
Te-hua guards would watch through the night, and
signal fires on Shufinne mesa would carry the word
quickly if help was needed.</p>
<p>A Navahu captive from Kah-po came with men of
Kah-po, and was left at Pu-y&eacute;. Juan Gonzalvo
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
stationed his own guards, having no fancy for sleep
with only painted savages between his troop and
danger. Ka-yemo for no stated reason lingered near,
and watched the Castilians, and watched Yahn
Tsyn-deh;&ndash;&ndash;so sullen and strong had grown his
jealousy that here in the hills&ndash;&ndash;apart from the
padre, he dared think what could be made happen to
the little cluster of white men if the Kah-po men
would join Povi-whah for battle,&ndash;&ndash;and if&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Under the eyes of Padre Vicente no such thought
would have dared come to him,&ndash;&ndash;but he had brief
wild desires to win by some stroke, a power such as
Tahn-t&eacute; held without question. Let the Castilian
whisper &ldquo;sorcerer&rdquo; ever so loudly, yet the old men
of Te-hua would give no heed without proofs&ndash;&ndash;and
who could make proofs against Tahn-t&eacute;?</p>
<p>The words of the governor had cut deep&ndash;&ndash;and
Yahn who was of the Tain-tsain clan, would rage if
the clan gained not credit by the war chief,&ndash;&ndash;and
Gonzalvo the man of iron,&ndash;&ndash;would then take her to
himself&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;He walked apart in rage. From
the ancient dwelling of the Po-Ahtun he could
hear the chanting of a war song. Tahn-t&eacute; was
invoking the spirits of battle&ndash;&ndash;Tahn-t&eacute; it was who
had seen the vision of warriors and started scouts to
the hills;&ndash;&ndash;on every side was he reminded that
Tahn-t&eacute; the priest&ndash;&ndash;was looked upon as Tahn-t&eacute;
the warrior heart!</p>
<p>The Castilians would go back to their own land
with that word to their people, and to their king;&ndash;&ndash;and
he, Ka-yemo,&ndash;&ndash;would have no mention unless
it should be of the weeds pulled in the corn!</p>
<p>His heart was so sick and so angry that he could
almost hear the laughter if he returned without
honors:&ndash;&ndash;but one man should not laugh!&ndash;&ndash;He did
not know how it would happen that he could have the
Capitan Gonzalvo killed&ndash;&ndash;but that man should not
laugh with Yahn Tsyn-deh!</p>

<p>In his sick rage he had brooded and walked far.
Along the summit of the mesa among the ruins had
he walked to the east. The weird dead city of the
Ancient Days was made more weird by the strange
brooding heat of the dusk. No cool air of the twilight
followed the setting sun this night. Sounds
carried far. No fires were lit in the camp below&ndash;&ndash;yet
movements of the animals told him where the
Castilians tethered their wonderful comrades of the
trail.</p>
<p>At any other time he would not have walked alone
on the heights where mystery touched each broken
wall, and wrapped the mesa as in a strange medicine
blanket. But in his impotent rage he felt spirit
forces of destruction working against him, and the
dread of them dulled his senses as to the place where
he wandered.</p>
<p>And then his heart jumped with a new fear as the
form of a woman arose from a crevice in the stone
wall&ndash;&ndash;did the ghost of the ruin wait for him there?</p>
<p>The figure halted uncertainly and then ran toward
him with outreaching hand.</p>
<p>It was Yahn Tsyn-deh, and she was half laughing
and half sobbing, and the barrier of anger was
brushed aside as if it had never been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ka-yemo!&ndash;&ndash;Ka-yemo!&rdquo; she whispered&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;You
dare be highest now;&ndash;&ndash;and Tahn-t&eacute; will be under
your feet, Ka-yemo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clasped her arms about him as she stumbled,
breathless, at his feet, and his hands clutched her in
fierceness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this a trick?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he asked. &ldquo;Have I trapped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
you with a lover, and you run to me with a new
game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;&ndash;fool, you!&rdquo; she breathed&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;There was
but one lover, and he went blind, and walked away
from me at a daybreak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would have said more, but he caught her up
and held her too close for speech, and she felt in
triumph the trembling of his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man Gonzalvo,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he muttered&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I was
walking to find the way I could kill him alone because
you wear his gifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; she whispered again. &ldquo;Shall I then go
to a woman at Shufinne and kill her because her gifts
are with you? I let her live to see that the gifts she
brings are little beside my own! I bring you victory
over Tahn-t&eacute; the sorcerer of Povi-whah! I bring
you the trail to his witch maid of the hills. With her
he comes to make prayers in the night time! For
this he guards the dwellings of the star where she is
hidden. Tahn-t&eacute; the sorcerer shall be under your
feet! Ka-yemo&ndash;&ndash;I bring this to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while they clung to each other, scarce daring
to think that union and triumph was again their
own, Tahn-t&eacute; the Ruler of magic sat within the
ancient dwelling where the symbols of the Po-Ahtun
are marked on the walls even in this day.</p>
<p>In a shadowed corner a tiny fire glimmered, and
by its light he studied the clear crystal of the sacred
fire-stone. With prayer he studied it long, and the
things speaking in the milky depths held him close,
and the breath stopped in his body many times while
he looked, and the prayers said through the Flute of
the Gods were prayers to the Trues to which he sent
all his spirit.</p>
<p>Then from his medicine pouch he took the seeds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
of the sacred by-otle into which the dreams of the
gods have ever grown as the blossom grows.</p>
<p>Darklings were these, gathered when the moon
was at rest, and no wandering stars swam high in the
night sky. The dreams in these shut out day knowledge,
and the knowledge of earth life. For medicine
dreams they shut out all of a man but that which is
Spirit, and the body becomes as a dead body knowing
not anything but dreams&ndash;&ndash;feeling neither heat nor
cold.</p>
<p>Of all medicine left on earth by the gods who once
walked here, not any medicine is so strong to lift the
soul to the Giver of Life even while the feet walk
here over trails of thorns, or the whipping thongs
cut bare to the bone the dancing flesh of penitents.</p>
<p>When Tahn-t&eacute; had listened to Padre Luis, and
had read of the grievous pain of that one Roman
crucifixion of the founder of the church of Padre
Luis, the boy had not been impressed as the good
priest had hoped. Even then he had heard of the
medicine drugs of different tribes, and the Medicine
Spirit granted to some, and as a man he knew that the
man to whom the gods give medicine gifts can make
for himself joy out of that which looks like pain.
He knew well that the earth born who drew to themselves
God-power, do not die, and the man on the
Roman cross could not die if his medicine Power of
the Spirit was strong. He knew that he had only
gone away as all the god-men and god-women have
gone away at times from earth places.</p>
<p>He knew that strong magic of the spirit could always
do this for a man if his heart was pure and
steady, but not to another could he give the spirit
power, or the heart of knowledge.</p>
<p>He counted over the seeds of the By-otle and knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
that there were enough to make even a strong man
dream of joy while under torture.</p>
<p>After that he dared look more closely into the
shifting lights of the sacred fire stone, and the Castilians
in the camp below, and the guards on the
level above, and the plotting woman, and her regained
slave and master heard the call of the Flute,
and intonings of sacred songs from the century old
dwelling of the Po-Ahtun.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE BATTLE ON THE MESA</h3>
</div>
<p>The stars had marked the middle of the
night, and the Castilian camp slept, save
for the guards who paced quietly through
the pine groves, and the Te-hua sentinels on the
summit above, who rested in silence at the places
where footholds carved by pre-historic Lost Others
in the face of the rock wall, afforded a trail for the
enemy if the enemy could find it.</p>
<p>Between the Castilians in the pine below, and the
Te-hua sentinels on the rock mesa of the ruins above,
there stretched the line of cave dwellings high in the
rock wall. These needed no guard&ndash;&ndash;for there the
Te-hua warriors slept, and Tahn-t&eacute; read the fate of
things in the crystal, and made prayers.</p>
<p>But to the east where he had forbidden wandering
feet, a man and woman did crouch in a crevice, and
watch while the shining ones overhead travelled to
the center of the sky and then towards the mountains
in the trail of the sun.</p>
<p>For Tahn-t&eacute; they watched&ndash;&ndash;and the watching
was so long that the man slept at intervals in the
arms of the woman&ndash;&ndash;but the woman did not sleep!
Victory was too near&ndash;&ndash;and triumph beat in her
blood, and like a panther of the hills waiting for prey
did she listen for the steps of the man who had known
her humiliation.</p>
<p>But when the steps did come, they came not from
the Po-Ahtun-ho, nor were they the steps of a man.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></div>
<p>A woman crept lightly as a mountain squirrel from
one to another of the boulders on the eastern hill, and
at last climbed to the dwellings of the Ancient Ones,
and reached the portal of the sacred place of the star.</p>
<p>This was the place where the wise men of old
watched the coming of the gods as they gazed upon
earth through the mask of the glimmering stars. It
was not a place for women, for no woman had been
Reader of the Stars within known records of the Te-hua
people. Yet it surely was a woman who crept
upwards in the night to the place where women
feared to go.</p>
<p>Yahn Tsyn-deh slipped like a snake from the
crevice and watched from the shadow of a rock, and
was richly repaid. It was the Woman of the Twilight
who came to the place where Tahn-t&eacute; had forbidden
the Castilians and warriors to walk, and
against the sky Yahn could see the outline of a water
jar borne on her back by the head-band of woven
hemp. She halted for breath, and leaned, a frail,
breathless ghost of a woman, against the wall.</p>
<p>Then with a pebble she tapped on the portal of
the star, four times she made the signal ere another
met her in the dusk, and took from her the burden,
and clung to her hand in dread.</p>
<p>In the dusk of the starlight they sat and whispered,
for no fire dare be lit within, and the girl of the bluebird
wing ate the bread and drank water, and
breathed her gratitude while she strove to understand
the words of the mother of Tahn-t&eacute;.</p>
<p>That there was danger she knew for she had seen
the many men. Like things enchanted had she seen
them&ndash;&ndash;the men who looked like part of the animals
they rode! In dread and fear had she waited for
Tahn-t&eacute; while she watched the Ancient Star glowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
like an eye of wrath in the western heavens. It was
looking back with an evil look because no gift had
been made to it on the altars of the valley people.
Tahn-t&eacute; had told her that so long as it shone must she
remain hidden. She did not need to ask why.
When with the Navahu savages she had been taunted
at times because the altars of her people knew well
the blood of human sacrifice which they offered with
elaborate ceremony to propitiate the gods of the stars
in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tahn-t&eacute;?&rdquo; she whispered to the mother, but the
mother shook her head. Apart from all woman-kind
must a priest live when times of stress come.
Tahn-t&eacute; was fasting and making prayers. A girl
hidden in the caves must not go hungry, but the
thought of her must not mingle with thoughts of
penance for the tribe. All heads of the spiritual
orders do penance and make prayers for clear vision
when the evil days come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they are here?&rdquo; questioned the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are here. The land was smiling, the corn
was good, all was good. Then the Great Star came&ndash;&ndash;and
the men of iron came&ndash;&ndash;the corn was laid low
by the God of the Winds. The Most Mysterious has
sent signs to his people, and the signs are evil and
come quickly. My son, the Po-Ahtun-ho, has seen
these signs, and the gods have talked with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid knew that a mere stray creature could
not find room in the thoughts of so great a man&ndash;&ndash;at
so great a time; and she sat silent, but she reached
out and held the hand of his mother. Since he could
not speak with her he had sent to her the woman
most high and most dear. He could not come, but
he had not forgotten!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will come again?&rdquo; she murmured, and some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
memory in the heart of the Twilight Woman made
her speech very gentle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will come again when the battle is over, and
the days of the purification are over. It is the work
of the Po-Ahtun-ho to see that the stranger is ever
fed and covered with a shelter. So has he brought
you here, and so has he brought the lion skin robe to
you here. When the young moon has grown to the
great circle, and the strangers have gone again to the
camp by the river, then will the Po-Ahtun-ho come to
you here in this place. He will come as the circle
moon rises over Na-im-be hills. Many prayers will
be made ere that night time, and he will come with
wisdom to say the thing to be done. Until then the
strangers must not see you, and the young foolish
men of our tribe must not see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not much of this was understood by the bewildered
maid who must be kept hidden in secret even in the
land of her own people.</p>
<p>But Yahn Tsyn-deh, crouching in the sand outside
the portal, heard and understood, and her heart was
glad with happiness, for a vengeance would fall
double strong on Tahn-t&eacute; if it touched also the medicine
god woman, his mother!</p>
<p>From the broken, whispered sentences&ndash;&ndash;half Navahu&ndash;&ndash;half
Te-hua&ndash;&ndash;did Yahn know that the
hidden woman was indeed the Navahu witch maid by
whom evil spirits had been led from the west into
the great valley.</p>
<p>It had been a wonder night in the life of Yahn
Tsyn-deh. The love of her wild heart had been
given back to her&ndash;&ndash;and vengeance against his rival
had been put within reach of her hands! The
heights of Pu-y&eacute; were enchanted&ndash;&ndash;and the Ancient
Star had shone on her with kindness. It was a good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
time in her life and she must work in quickness ere
the change came, for the watchful gods of the sky
do not stand still when the signs are good signs.</p>
<p>And she crept back to the arms of her lover, and
they watched together the medicine shadow woman
creep downward until the dark hid her.</p>
<p>Yahn counseled that at once they go to the governor
and tell that which they heard, but Ka-yema said
&ldquo;no,&rdquo; for if the Navahu enemy did come, the power
of Tahn-t&eacute; was needed by the Te-hua warriors&ndash;&ndash;it
was not the time to kill the witch woman or kill the
prayer thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are strong to fight without Tahn-t&eacute;,&rdquo; whispered
the girl who made herself as a vine in her clinging
clasp of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not to fight against Tahn-t&eacute; and his secret
powers of the sky,&rdquo; answered Ka-yemo. &ldquo;The old
men know he is strong in visions. When the time
comes that he fall low in their sight, there will be
many days that their hearts will be sick. We must
not make these days come when we have enemies to
fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you fear?&rdquo; demanded the temptress petulantly.
It irked her that his first thought was of
caution&ndash;&ndash;while hers was of annihilation for the man
who loomed so large that no other man could be seen
in the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think I fear would you find me here in this
witch place with you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It has been
forbidden that any one comes here&ndash;&ndash;yet have I
come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plainly he felt brave that he had defied the Po-Ahtun-ho
in so much as he had walked to the forbidden
sacred places, and Yahn felt a storm of rage
sweep over her at the knowledge. But it had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
a storm of rage like that by which he had once been
driven away from her! And she smothered all the
words she would have spoken, and clung to him, and
whispered of his greatness,&ndash;&ndash;and the pride he could
bring to the clan when Tahn-t&eacute;, the lover of witches,
no longer made laws in the land.</p>
<p>In her own heart she was making prayers that the
alarm of the Navahu warriors prove a false thing,
and the vision of Tahn-t&eacute; be laughed at by the clans.
To hear him laughed at would help much!</p>
<p>But that was not to be, for ere the dawn broke,
came shouts from Shufinne&ndash;&ndash;and signal fires, and
the Te-hua men of Pu-y&eacute; ran swiftly to guide their
Castilian brothers in arms, and the savages who had
hoped to steal women in the darkness, found that
thunder and lightning and death fought for the Te-hua
people&ndash;&ndash;and the men of iron rode them down
with the charm&eacute;d animals and strange battle cries.</p>
<p>When the daylight came there were dead Navahu
on the field south of Shufinne&ndash;&ndash;the flower of the
shields had bloom! Two dead Te-hua men were also
there, and a wounded Navahu had been taken captive
by Juan Gonzalvo. Ka-yemo carried two fresh
scalps, and Don Ruy lay huddled in a little arroyo,
where a lance thrust had struck him reeling from the
saddle, and Tahn-t&eacute; had leaped forward to grapple
with the Navahu who, hidden on the edge of the
steep bank, waited the coming of the horseman and
lunged at him as head and shoulders came above the
level.</p>
<p>Where the breastplate ends at the throat he struck,
and the blade of volcanic glass cut through the flesh.
At the savage yell of triumph the horse swerved&ndash;&ndash;stumbled,
and with a clatter of metals rolled down
the embankment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></div>
<p>As the Navahu rushed downward with lifted axe
and eager scalping knife, an arrow from the bow of
Tahn-t&eacute; pierced the temple of the savage, and with
a grunt he whirled and fell dead beside the Castilian.</p>
<p>The horse had quickly regained his feet, but the
rider lay still, the blood pulsing from his throat and
staining the yellow sand. With dextrous fingers
Tahn-t&eacute; removed the helmet and breastplate that the
position of the body might be eased. With sinew of
deer from his pouch, and a bone awl of needle-like
sharpness, he drew together the edges of the wound,
then turning to where the Navahu lay prone on his
face in the sand, he deftly cut a strip of the brown
skin a finger&rsquo;s width across, and in length from
shoulder to girdle; this he took from the yet warm
body as he would take the bark from a willow tree,
and bound it about the throat with the flesh side to
the wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my horse and follow,&rdquo; whispered Don
Ruy, who had recovered breath and speech,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I am
not yet so dead that I need the grave digger&ndash;&ndash;you
can ride&ndash;&ndash;take my horse and follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; had leaped to the saddle, when a cry at
the edge of the arroyo caused him to halt, it was so
pitiful a cry, and tumbling down through the sand
and gravel came Master Chico with staring eyes of
fear, and lips that were pale and quivering. The
flayed back of the savage had he caught sight of, and
the white face of Don Ruy who looked dead enough
for masses despite his own assertion to the contrary,
and the lad flung himself on his excellency with a
wail that was far from that of a warrior, and then
slipped silently into unconsciousness.</p>
<p>With the thought that a death wound had struck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
the lad who had come to die with his master, Tahn-t&eacute;
turned the face back until the head rested on the arm
of the Castilian, lightly he ran his hands over the
body, and then halted, his eyes on the face of Don
Ruy, who gazed strangely at the white face on his
arm. The cap was gone, the eyes were closed, and
the open lips showed the white teeth. In every way
the face was more childish than it had ever appeared
to him&ndash;&ndash;childish and something more&ndash;&ndash;something&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Then Tahn-t&eacute;, who held the wrist of Chico, laid
it gently on the hand of Don Ruy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only into the twilight land has she gone, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;
he said softly&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;even now the heart beats on the
trail to come back&ndash;&ndash;to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ruy stared incredulously into the eyes of the
Indian, and a flush crept over his own pale face as
he remembered many things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Bradamante!&rdquo; he murmured, and nodded
to Tahn-t&eacute;, who leaped on the horse and rode where
the yells of the victors sounded in the pi&ntilde;ons towards
the hills. Beyond all the other horsemen he rode,
and saw far above in the scrubby growth, the enemy
seeking footholds where the four-footed animals
could not follow. Then, when Ka-yemo had called
the names of the trailers who were to follow the
enemy beyond the summit, Tahn-t&eacute; the Po-Athun-ho
turned back and chanted the prayer of a prophet to
whom the god had sent true dreams.</p>
<p>The Castilians watched him as he came; so proudly
did he carry himself that the men swore an army of
such horsemen would win half the battle by merely
showing themselves, and the old men of Te-hua knew
as they looked on him, and as they counted the slain
and wounded, that Tahn-t&eacute; had indeed been given the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
gift of the god-sight to save the women of the valley.</p>
<p>Juan Gonzalvo swore ugly oaths at sight of the
horse of Don Ruy. Since the pagan had taken it as
his own, it was plain to be seen that some woeful thing
had chanced to his excellency.</p>
<p>But to their many questions Tahn-t&eacute; led them to
the arroyo where Don Ruy was indeed wounded, and
where a pale secretary was carrying water in his hat
to bathe his excellency&rsquo;s head, and his excellency let
it be done, and exchanged a long look of silence with
Tahn-t&eacute;, who understood.</p>
<p>The ankle of Don Ruy had a twist making it of
no use to stand upon. The Po-Ahtun-ho made a
gesture to Chico to hold the horse while he, with a
soldier to help, put it straight with a dextrous wrench,
and the secretary several paces away, turned white at
the pain of it.</p>
<p>Then was his excellency helped again to his saddle,
and the men from Mexico marvelled at the surgery
of the pagan priest who killed and flayed one man to
mend another with.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE APACHE DEATH TRAP</h3>
</div>
<p>When the runners carried the word to the
river that the vision of Tahn-t&eacute; had been
a true vision, the padre and Don Diego
stared at each other incredulous. It was a thing
not to be believed by a Christian. Yet the runners
said that many Navahu scalps and two dead Te-hua
men witnessed the truth of it, and the men
of iron had proven indeed brothers in the time of
battle. The governor made thanks to Don Ruy, who
was wounded, and his Excellency had sent the secretary
back to camp with Ysobel since there was not
anything new to record. The Te-hua men would
dance the scalp dance when they came to the village,
and two clans mourned for men left dead on the mesa
meadows.</p>
<p>The padre regretted that he had not gone with the
troop. Since they had won honor and thanks, it was
the good time to work for the one favor of the gold
in return.</p>
<p>And Don Diego regretted the Te-hua men who
had died without absolution.</p>
<p>The secretary stated that the clans of the dead men
were clamoring for the Navahu captive taken by
Gonzalvo, and there was much talk about it. Also
that the Navahu said it was one maid they came
searching for&ndash;&ndash;a Navahu maid who wore bluebird
wings&ndash;&ndash;they had not thought to harm Te-hua
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
women! Of course the Te-hua men thought that was
a lie, for the Navahu always wanted more women.</p>
<p>But the old men of the village to whom it was told
looked at each other with meaning.</p>
<p>It was a strange thing that the men of Te-gat-ha
to the north, and the men of Navahu from the west,
took the trail to search for that one maid of mystery.
The ground over which she passed had reached
far, and the evil wrought by her had been great.
The wise men of Te-gat-ha knew that the tornado followed
her trail, and the Navahu men who searched
for her, had found death and defeat. Prayers must
be made against the evil of her if her feet should
cross the land of the Te-hua people.</p>
<p>And all through the long beautiful twilight the
tomb&eacute; sounded from the terraces, and the mourners
for the dead on the high mesas knew that prayers
were being made against new evil&ndash;&ndash;and that the
medicine men would in an early day demand penance
and sacrifice of many if the cloud of dread was not
lifted from their hearts.</p>
<p>Four days of purification must be observed by the
warriors ere entering again their home village after
a battle to the death. And Yahn could not by any
means approach Ka-yemo during that time, which
did not prevent her speech with other men. To
Juan Gonzalvo she talked, and Gonzalvo chafed
under the restrictions of Don Ruy. Steadily in his
mind had grown that thought of the parentage of
Tahn-t&eacute;. He was unwilling to think that the native
mind could have the keenness and the logic of this
barbarian whose eyes were the color of the darkest
blue violets, and whose diabolic power made even the
Castilians awe-struck, and sent them to prayers more
swiftly than did the sermons of the padre. If he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
only dared hint it to the padre&ndash;&ndash;if by some god-given
power he, the insolent Cacique, could be delivered
into their hands&ndash;&ndash;if as the son of Teo the
Greek, he could come within the law of the Inquisition
for his devilish heresies&ndash;&ndash;the all too lenient
Inquisition demanded white blood in its victims&ndash;&ndash;what
a triumph it would be for the Faith to add the
sorcerer to the list! For such a triumph would Gonzalvo
have been willing to tread with bared feet all
the sands of the trail to Mexico.</p>
<p>With such pious intent did he question much of
Yahn, who knew little&ndash;&ndash;and was indeed afraid when
the medicine god woman was asked of. She had seen
that which had come to the outcast of Na-im-be who
would have told tribal things, and she had no wish
to grow dumb, or blind, or a trembling wreck in the
time of one sun across the sky.</p>
<p>But she did go with him to the place of the well
in the sand at Shufinne at the time when the Twilight
Woman went for water. He waited there and
drew for her the water, and watched closely her face
as he spoke a Castilian word of greeting. If he had
hope that she had ever before heard such words his
hopes were fruitless. She was so indifferent to his
presence that not even once did she lift her eyes
from the water jar or look in his face, and the fragile
figure turned from him and walked away as if Castilian
warriors were seen daily on the path to that
well.</p>
<p>Yahn knew that all the other women wished greatly
to be let go down to the village that they might see
and be spoken to by the great strangers, and she hid
in the brush to watch the medicine god woman and
even won courage to ask of her who had filled the
water jar so quickly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Was it not then the stranger who is your lover,
Yahn Tsyn-deh?&rdquo; asked the other, not as one who
cares, but as one who states a fact&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the man whom
you give love to in these new days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says I give love?&rdquo; demanded Yahn.
&ldquo;S&auml;h-pah the liar, or Koh-p&eacute;, who knows not anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You walk together alone as lovers walk. The
other women do not think they lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are fools&ndash;&ndash;the other women!&rdquo; stated
Yahn&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;also they are liars. They are glad if a
man of the beard looks the way they are,&ndash;&ndash;they
would make a trail to follow if the men of iron
whistled them,&ndash;&ndash;they would be proud to make their
own men ashamed&ndash;&ndash;they!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time the older woman looked in the
face of the girl with intentness, as though suddenly
aroused to interest in the human drama about her, and
the actors in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you would not follow, Yahn Tsyn-deh?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;The others say you laugh at the men
of the tribe and give love to the strangers&ndash;&ndash;they
say you pass Ka-yemo on the trail and your eyes never
see him any more because of the men of iron who give
you gifts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A jealous woman says that!&rdquo; stormed Yahn
Tsyn-deh,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;a woman who maybe lies to him when
he will listen! You see this:&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and she picked up a
black water worn pebble with a vein of white through
the heart of it&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Sometime when the Earth
Mother was beginning with the work, these two were
maybe not together like this. They were apart&ndash;&ndash;maybe
it was before the ice went from around our
world and the mountains sent fire to split the rocks.
Look you now&ndash;&ndash;you are wise, but maybe you do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
not know how this is, for you go into shadow lands,
and men and women, and the stones over which your
feet walk, are all the same to you&ndash;&ndash;also the love of
a man and a woman are not anything to your
thoughts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other looked at her, and beyond her, and said
nothing. The words of Yahn were words of angry
insistence on the thought she had never yet been able
to express&ndash;&ndash;and to say it to even the god medicine
woman who sheltered a witch, was to speak it aloud,
and have it forgotten!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wise in medicine craft but do you know
how this grew?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she demanded&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I know&ndash;&ndash;I
feel that <i>I know</i>!&ndash;&ndash;the mountain fire or the sky fire
broke it that the white stone of fire could be shot like
an arrow into the heart of it. To keep some count
it was made like that by the Most Mysterious;&ndash;&ndash;and
in the hand of the Mystery it was held&ndash;&ndash;and the
hand was closed over it while the mountains came
down to the rivers, and the rivers made trails through
rock walls. When the hand was opened and the sun
looked on it, it was grown into one;&ndash;&ndash;can you with
all high medicine put them apart?&ndash;&ndash;can you break
the black and leave the white not broke? Can you
make two colors of the powder you would grind from
it between grinding stones?&ndash;&ndash;Yet the two colors are
there! Like the two colors are Ka-yemo and Yahn
Tsyn-deh. One they were made by some magic of
the Great Mystery, and no woman and no man, and
no lies of women, can break them apart! When you
hear them lie another time, you can look at this stone,
and know that I said it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had worked herself into such a passion that the
long smothered rage against the women who spoke
her name lightly in the village spent itself on the one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
woman of all who lived most apart from such speech.
But aloud had Yahn Tsyn-deh said once for all that
her life was as the life of Ka-yemo, and that no earth
creature could make that different, and for the saying
of it aloud she was a happier woman.</p>
<p>And Gonzalvo who listened to her defiance, fancied
that the silent woman of mystery had given her chiding,
and that Yahn was doing wordy battle for the
new Castilian friends.</p>
<p>All the more could he think so when Yahn joined
him with her great eyes shining like stars, and braided
in her hair some flowers he had plucked for her&ndash;&ndash;and
walked back to the camp with him openly before all
men!</p>
<p>And she said to him;&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I like only men who
fight,&ndash;&ndash;men who are not afraid. Tell your priest
who does not like me that now is the time to speak
again to the council of the sun symbol and of brothers.
The old men have seen that your fighting was good,
and that it saved them their women. This will be
the time to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But their proud Cacique&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a good time to speak&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she insisted&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;else
will Tahn-t&eacute; grow so tall with prophecies that
his shadow will cover the land, and the men in the
land,&ndash;&ndash;tell your priest that the shadow has grown too
tall now for one man. Other men have fought well
and taken scalps&ndash;&ndash;yet only one name is heard in your
camp&ndash;&ndash;the name of Tahn-t&eacute; who sees visions in the
hills!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wondered at her mocking tone of the visions
in the hills, for no other Indian mocked at the
visions of the sorcerer.</p>
<p>Don Ruy was well agreed to get back to the fair
camp by the river, and so pleased with them were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
their new comrades in arms, that he was amused to
see more than one dame of the village trudging homewards
across the mesa:&ndash;&ndash;they forgot to doubt the
new allies who had helped send the Navahu running
to the hills. When he reached Povi-whah he rallied
Chico that he kept close to the camp and found so
many remembered records to put safely down the
&ldquo;Relaciones,&rdquo; when there were more than a few pairs
of strange dark eyes peeping from the terraces.</p>
<p>But Chico had quite lost the swagger of the adventurous
youth since he tumbled down the arroyo
bank almost on top of the flayed savage. The fainting
fit need not have caused him so much of shyness,
since his Excellency had also apparently indulged in
the same weakness;&ndash;&ndash;for Chico on awaking had
carried two hats full of water and drenched his highness
completely ere he had opened his eyes and again
looked on the world. However, without doubt that
fainting fit of Master Chico&rsquo;s had taken away a fine
lot of self confidence, for ink-horn and paper gave
all the excitement he craved. His audacity was gone,
and so meek and lowly was his spirit, that Don Diego
had much pleasure in the thought that the vocation
of the lad was plainly the church, and that sight of
the dead, unconfessed barbarians, had awakened his
conscience as to human duties for the Faith.</p>
<p>This interesting fact he made mention of to Don
Ruy, who bade him god speed in making missionaries
out of unexpected material,&ndash;&ndash;and got more amusement
out of the idea than one would expect, and
Don Diego hinted that it was unseemly to jest at
serious matters of the saving of souls when his own
had stood so good a chance at escape through the
hole in his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be that I found a soul through that same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
wound,&rdquo; said Don Ruy, &ldquo;at least I gained enough
to make amends for the scar to be left by the wicked
lance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true that the knowledge gained of their
savage surgery is a thing of import for the &lsquo;Relaciones,&rsquo;&rdquo;
agreed Don Diego,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but only the infidel
Cacique made practice of it, and his acts are scarcely
the kind to bring a blessing on any work&ndash;&ndash;I have
been put to it to decide how little space to give his
name in these pages. It is not a seemly thing that
the most wicked should be the most exalted in the
chronicles of our travels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether exalted or not he must be again considered
in this quest of the gold,&rdquo; stated Padre
Vicente, &ldquo;Gonzalvo brings me word that more than
one of the tribe would have joy in his downfall, and
that it is the good time to talk with the head men
openly on this question. Our men have helped fight
their battles:&ndash;&ndash;thus matters have changed for us.
Many of the women are allowed to come home&ndash;&ndash;they
perceive we are as brothers and are not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They also perceive that we have a Navahu war
captive whom they desire exceedingly for use on the
altar of the Mesa of the Hearts,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;observed Don
Ruy. &ldquo;They are much disturbed for lack of a sacrifice
these days. They say the Ancient Star will send
earth troubles until such sacrifice is made, some of the
clans must donate a member unless the gods send a
substitute&ndash;&ndash;their preference is for a young and
comely youth or maiden. They plainly hinted to
Gonzalvo that the Navahu has been given into our
hands by the gods for that purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Diego was emphatic in his horror, but the
padre explained that from the heathen point of view
it was not so cruel as might be thought. When the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
savages went to war they prepared themselves for
such fate if captured. More:&ndash;&ndash;the death was not
torture. The ceremonies were religious according to
the pagan idea&ndash;&ndash;chants and prayers and garlands of
flowers and sacred pine were a part of the ritual.
The blade of sacrifice must be sharp, and the heart
removed from the victim quickly and held to the sun
or the star behind which the angry god waited.
When it was a sacrifice of much high import, it was
made on the Mesa of the Hearts, and in remembrance
a heart shaped stone was always left near the shrine
by one of the secondary priests:&ndash;&ndash;for that reason
one could find many heart shaped stones, large and
small on that mesa. When a medicine man found
one, even in a far hunting ground, he brought it home
for that purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the body of the victim?&rdquo; asked Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I
have been on that mesa and seen no bones&ndash;&ndash;what
becomes of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is trouble of floods or storm or drouth, the
victim is thrown to the god of the river below. On
the mesa to the west is an ancient circle of stones
with the entrance to the east. The ordinary sacrifice
is made there for good crops, and the body is divided
until each clan may have at least a portion which he
consumes with many prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Diego confessed that such ritual sat ill upon
even a healthy stomach, for his own part the open air
seemed good and desirable, and he was of a mind to
return whence they had come, rather than risk longer
unauthorized visits among such smiling soft voiced
savages. Since his eminence had learned thus much
of their horrors, who was to know how many might
be left untold?&ndash;&ndash;or how soon the tribes might have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
a mind to circle the camp and offer every mother&rsquo;s son
of the Christians on some such devilish altar?</p>
<p>Even while he spoke a curious shock ran through
the men, and they stared at each other in amaze and
question. Plainly the floor had lifted under their
feet as though some demon of the Underworld had
heaved himself upward in turning over in his sleep.</p>
<p>Screams and loud cries were heard from the
terraces, men came tumbling up the ladders from the
kivas, and Master Chico let fall a slender treasured
volume of Se&ntilde;or Ariosto&rsquo;s romances and ran, white
faced and breathless to Don Ruy, who caught and
held him while the world swayed about them.</p>
<p>In truth he did not even release him so quickly as
might be after the tremor had passed, but no man
had time or humor to note the care with which he
held the secretary, or that it was the lad himself who
drew, flushing red, from the embrace of very strong
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I feared you might not know&ndash;&ndash;I came to
tell you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; was the lame explanation to which Don
Ruy listened, and smiled while he listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what &lsquo;Do&ntilde;a Bradamante&rsquo; would have
done in all her bravery of white armor if such an
earth wave had shaken her tilting court?&rdquo; he asked,
but the secretary did not know, and with face still
flushed, and eyes on the ground, went to seek Yahn
Tsyn-deh to hear if this was a usual thing that walls
lifted in wavy lines&ndash;&ndash;and that chimneys toppled
from Te-hua dwellings.</p>
<p>The old people said it was long since the earth
had shaken itself, and they watched closely the Mesa
of the Hearts, and the mesa of the god-maid face,
and a mountain over towards Te-gat-ha. If the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
anger of the earth was great against earth people,
then smoke would come from certain earth breathing
places,&ndash;&ndash;and the sentinels kept watch&ndash;&ndash;and the old
men watched also.</p>
<p>And around the village went a murmur of dire import&ndash;&ndash;for
it was plain that the Great Mystery was
sending many signs to the Te-hua people;&ndash;&ndash;the altars
had been too long empty!</p>
<p>A strange foreboding filled the air, and the Castilians
gathered in little groups and talked. To send
the Navahu captive to his death at the hands of the
tribe was not to their fancy, but if a member of a
Te-hua clan must be offered up, who could tell what
vengeance that clan might not take on the strangers?</p>
<p>Padre Vicente looked over all, and listened to
much, and then talked to the governor:&ndash;&ndash;was it not
the time to take strong brothers that they share both
the evil and the good together?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gods are certainly not well pleased with us,
we make offerings and we make prayers&ndash;&ndash;and the
only good they let come to us has been our brothers
of the iron and thunder and the fire sticks,&rdquo; said
Phen-tzah. &ldquo;Yes, I think it is the time to take
brothers of a strong god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the word of the governor and it was the
strongest word yet given for union. But the governor
made it plain that he did not belong to the order
holding secret of the sun symbol. The Po-Athun
were the people who must decide these spirit things.
He thought the hearts of the old men of that order
were kind and soft for the strangers, but&ndash;&ndash;the head
of that order was Tahn-t&eacute;, the Po-Athun-ho!</p>
<p>This gave pause for thought, every man who chose
to go contrary to the will of Tahn-t&eacute;, found himself
well nigh helpless in the Indian land, his infernal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
gods were so strong that the Castilians were none
too eager to flout them, only Yahn Tsyn-deh seeing
the crisis of things, crept to Juan Gonzalvo and
whispered,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hate the Po-Athun-ho&ndash;&ndash;and you say love
words to me. You think you want me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juan Gonzalvo was a blunt soldier who had never
before been kept at the distance of Tantalus by an
Indian girl who took his gifts. On her brown neck
a silver necklace of his shone richly, and in her braided
hair corals of the sea gleamed red. While others
had fled to the altars for prayers,&ndash;&ndash;and sprinkled
sacred pollen to the Go-h&eacute;-yahs&ndash;&ndash;the mediators between
earth and spirit world&ndash;&ndash;Yahn had bathed in
the river and made herself beautiful with Castilian
gifts and barbaric trinketry.</p>
<p>To the man who measured her with eager eyes,
she looked beautiful as the Te-hua goddess of whom
she had told him&ndash;&ndash;Ta-ah-quea who brings the
Spring.</p>
<p>He told her so while he devoured her with his
glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You give me love, and you
hate the Po-Athun-ho. You can have us both if your
heart is brave this night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His arms would have clasped her for that promise,
but she eluded him and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Don Ruy tells you the Po-Athun-ho must
have no harm,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;but is there not
among your men, one, maybe even three soldiers who
are master of the bow,&ndash;&ndash;and can destroy in silence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gonzalvo was himself a master bowman&ndash;&ndash;and
had some pride in knowing it, also he could if need be,
pick men of his company who had skill, and could be
trusted.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Could you send these men as if to hunt or to
fish,&ndash;&ndash;could you have them find the way past the
Te-hua sentinels to the place where they camped in
the pines?&rdquo; and she made a gesture towards Pu-y&eacute;.
&ldquo;Could you secretly find your way there in the dark
before the Mother Moon looks full on the face of
the earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do this&ndash;&ndash;and I can do more than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you win for your people the good heart of
the council that they show you the sun symbol?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;Only Tahn-t&eacute; closes the door to you, and
they fear Tahn-t&eacute;. Tell me why your hate of him
is strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His father was the Devil. Through the devil
soul he learns magic things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! You hear the wise men tell of a maid
of evil who brought the tornado and the battle&ndash;&ndash;and
now brings this shake of the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The witch maid,&rdquo; and Gonzalvo crossed himself&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;the
men speak of her in whispers&ndash;&ndash;and
the Indians say a sacrifice must be made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be made,&rdquo; said Yahn Tsyn-deh, and her
white teeth shut tight in decision. &ldquo;Maybe it happens
that you can make it, and win the council&ndash;&ndash;how
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;make the sacrifice&ndash;&ndash;I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not where the altar is,&rdquo; soothed Yahn as he recoiled
from the thought. &ldquo;But listen you!&ndash;&ndash;maybe
I dream&ndash;&ndash;but listen!&ndash;&ndash;maybe the witch maid is a
human thing with the heart of magic like Tahn-t&eacute;,&ndash;&ndash;maybe
I can find them together for you in the sacred
place of the stars in Pu-y&eacute;. Maybe the spirit of
Tahn-t&eacute; has been traded into her keeping, and with
the double strength of evil she will destroy the earth
in this place. The stars say so;&ndash;&ndash;a great evil is
coming! The medicine men see it in the sacred
vessels of water and in the clear stone of the ancient
prophets&ndash;&ndash;they say so! You are a brave heart&ndash;&ndash;you
can save these people and win the gold secret
from the council. If you want Yahn Tsyn-deh for
love you will do this thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gonzalvo stared at her incredulous, she was crediting
him with a power that would place him high in
the Castilian camp&ndash;&ndash;if he could win! And more&ndash;&ndash;she
was to give him her own intense, glowing, restless
self!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also hate Tahn-t&eacute;,&ndash;&ndash;that is why!&rdquo; she said
frankly, &ldquo;and I love only men who are brave above
all other men. Your fire sticks of thunder must not
be heard on the heights of Pu-y&eacute;, but when Tahn-t&eacute;
and the witch meet there in the night, your arrows
must send them together to the Afterworld&ndash;&ndash;not
one alone&ndash;&ndash;but <i>together</i>! When the men of Te-hua
find the dead witch (for the men of Te-gat-ha
and the Navahu can witness that it is the one!) and
when they find the lion robe of Tahn-t&eacute; on her body,&ndash;&ndash;and
other gifts of Tahn-t&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;and find them dead
the one beside the other, then the man who has made
this happen will be a great man! Even the men of
Te-gat-ha will come with gifts, and the men of Te-hua
will give you honor, and will open the trail for
you to the sun symbol. There will be no Tahn-t&eacute;
to put evil magic on them for doing so! When he
is found dead with the witch maid they will see
clearly that his magic was evil magic, and they will
have breath that is deep and free again. Also I&ndash;&ndash;Yahn
Tsyn-deh&ndash;&ndash;will walk beside you where you
choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Low and rapid was her speech there in the shadow
of the adobe wall&ndash;&ndash;and so fair was the dream she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
made clear for him, that he felt himself grow dazed
with the glory of it&ndash;&ndash;yet he was a strong man!</p>
<p>If it was true that Tahn-t&eacute; and the witch nested
together in the ruins of Pu-y&eacute;, he knew well that the
day of the young Ruler was ended in Povi-whah, or
in any Te-hua council where it was known. But the
strange mental or spiritual power of Tahn-t&eacute; made it
a thing of danger to let him live after accusal had
been made. The way of Yahn seemed the best of
all ways. If he was found dead beside the maid accursed,
the evidence would be clear against him&ndash;&ndash;and
the True Faith would have the credit for such
extermination!</p>
<p>He knew this was not a thing to speak of to Don
Ruy&ndash;&ndash;and though the padre was enemy to every
thought of Tahn-t&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;he feared even the padre&ndash;&ndash;that
strange man who knew so much that was hidden
in Indian life, would so clearly see that Yahn
Tsyn-deh was as much the motive as gain of the gold,
or glory for Mother Church.</p>
<p>No,&ndash;&ndash;it was a thing to think out alone.</p>
<p>Yahn pressed his hand furtively and smiled on him
as he left her, and then entered her own dwelling and
sprinkled prayer meal to the spirits who carry messages
to the gods.</p>
<p>Then she sent a child for Ka-yemo and gave the
child some dried peaches that he be content to stay
with his fellows in the sunshine and eat them.</p>
<p>Ka-yemo entered her dwelling for the first time in
many moons and clasped her close, and then seated
himself in the farthest corner from the Apache god
pictures while Yahn Tsyn-deh talked.</p>
<p>Her voice was low, and often she went to the opening
to see that no one listened, and Ka-yemo was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
wonder-struck at the greatness of the thing she
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have won scalps in this battle&ndash;&ndash;you have
led the men in the scalp dance, and the people know
you are strong. If Tahn-t&eacute; went out of the world
now, at this time, you would be strongest. This is
the time he must go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if the vengeance of the Castilians came
heavy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not come heavy. Don Ruy has forbidden
Gonzalvo even to speak words against Tahn-t&eacute; to
the padre. So it is that he would be angry if Gonzalvo
sent arrows into the Po-Ahtun-ho. <i>You</i> must
not do it, for his magic power might come heavy on
your head. If you fear to destroy the Castilian
capitan you are foolish in your thought&ndash;&ndash;for it need
never be known. Look!&ndash;&ndash;here are arrows of the
Navahu, from the place of battle I gathered many,
these are the arrows for the work. Let Gonzalvo
risk the magic of Tahn-t&eacute;, and the magic of the
witch maid, and destroy them, then you must alone,
trail the Castilian, that he comes not back alive to
tell how it was done! The Navahu arrows will take
the blame from your head&ndash;&ndash;it will be plain that
some Navahu men stayed to take pay for their dead!
So it will be, and you, Ka-yemo, will stand high, and
your clan will be proud that no man stands more
high. And I&ndash;&ndash;Yahn&ndash;&ndash;will be with you each step
of the life trail&ndash;&ndash;and each step we dare look down
on all others and be proud. The songs you sing can
be proud songs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blood of Ka-yemo jumped in his veins at that
picture of victory as drawn by Yahn Tsyn-deh. Now,
since she had asked him to destroy Juan Gonzalvo
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
was he at last content in the thought that her love had
not wandered from him, Ka-yemo! Even in the days
of silence and anger had he held her spirit;&ndash;&ndash;and to
do that with a woman is proof that a man is strong!
It made him feel there in the dwelling of Yahn the
Apache, that he could do battle in the open for her
with the Castilian capitan if need be and have no
fear;&ndash;&ndash;how much more then would he dare do the
work to be done in secret on the heights!</p>
<p>Thus did Yahn Tsyn-deh spin her web that Tahn-t&eacute;
and the maid of the forest be caught in its meshes,
and it seemed good to her that the men of iron be
killed when chance offered;&ndash;&ndash;especially must the
Castilian capitan not be let live to tell the clan of
Tahn-t&eacute; aught of how the plan was made;&ndash;&ndash;and
above all had she spoken truth to the Woman of the
Twilight by the path to the well:&ndash;&ndash;her life was as
the life of Ka-yemo;&ndash;&ndash;if the Castilian escaped and
dared claim the price she offered&ndash;&ndash;!</p>
<p>At that thought Yahn felt for the knife in her
girdle, and had joy that the edge of it was keen as
the steel of the Castilians, and her smile was a
threat as she almost felt her hand thrust and twist it
in the flesh of the man of iron who had dared think
himself the equal of Ka-yemo!</p>
<p>Some savage creatures of the wilderness there are
who choose their mates, and stand, to live or to die,
against all foes who would break the bond. The
tigress will watch her mate do battle for her and then
follow his conqueror,&ndash;&ndash;but Yahn Tsyn-deh had not
even so much as that meekness of the tiger in her;&ndash;&ndash;her
own share of the battle would she fight that the
mate she chose should remain unconquered. Proud
she was of his beauty and of his grace in the scalp
dance,&ndash;&ndash;but more proud would she be when no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
serene young Po-Athun-ho looked at her lover as if
from a high place of thought. It was, strangely
enough, the <i>unspoken</i> in Tahn-t&eacute; against which she
rebelled in bitterness. No word that was not gentle
had he ever spoken to her&ndash;&ndash;and to Ka-yemo no word
that lacked dignity. It was as if the man in his
thoughts was enthroned on the clouds:&ndash;&ndash;and at last
she had found the way for that cloud to be dragged
low in the dust!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE CHOICE OF YAHN TSYN-DEH</h3>
</div>
<p>And while Yahn Tsyn-deh laid the trap, and
the medicine drums sounded, and the women
gathered the children close because of the
trembling earth, one girl robed in the skin of a mountain
lion waited alone at the portal of the star, and
knelt in the shadow, and looked with eyes of fear at
the great pieces of severed cliff, or ancient wall sent
crashing downwards by the force of the earth shock.</p>
<p>Past her portal they had crashed until it seemed
the roof must fall also, and she gathered the robe of
Tahn-t&eacute; about her, and came as far as might be into
the open&ndash;&ndash;and watched with longing eyes the trail
across the mesa to the great river!&ndash;&ndash;for that trail
was as the path of the sun to her,&ndash;&ndash;or the rainbow in
the sky!</p>
<p>The feet of Tahn-t&eacute; had touched that trail, and
when the night came, and the moon rose in the great
circle over the eastern hills&ndash;&ndash;over that trail would
he come, and though the mountains themselves
crashed downwards to the mesa, he would hold her
close, and the very spirits of darkness could send no
more fear!</p>
<p>She kept very still there waiting at the portal, for
strange noises were heard on the mesa, a dislodged
stone rumbling down the long slope&ndash;&ndash;or a bit of
loose clay falling from the ancient walls. At times
the smaller sounds suggested passing feet&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
above all things must she remain hidden from people
until he came for her&ndash;&ndash;he&ndash;&ndash;the god-like one who
had brought her to this dwelling so akin to the
dwellings of the Divine Ones of the Navahu land in
the place called Ts&eacute;-ye. The difference was that the
Ts&eacute;-ye dwellings were deep in the heart of the world&ndash;&ndash;while
these dwellings were lifted high above the
world.</p>
<p>But she knew without words that he indeed belonged
to the Divine Ones ere he brought her to the
ancient dwellings. That her name had been in his
heart, and on his lips before she herself had told him,
was but a part of the strange sweet magic of the new
life into which he had led her.</p>
<p>Through the storms&ndash;&ndash;and the dark nights&ndash;&ndash;and
the long days of loneliness had she lived since he had
hidden her first from the scouts of Te-gat-ha&ndash;&ndash;but
they had passed over her as dreams of sweetness pass.&ndash;&ndash;That
the groves of pine, or the mesa of the river,
hid him from her sight, did not mean to her that he
had quite gone away, the wonderful magic wrought
by him made it possible for her to feel his arms about
her even when she lay alone in the darkness of the
dwelling of the star. To be hidden like that, and to
watch for his coming, was to be granted much joy by
the gods. That the gods exact payment for all joys
more than mortal, was one secret Tahn-t&eacute; did not
whisper to her, though the thought had clouded his
own eyes more than once as he clasped her close to
him.</p>
<p>What the gods would exact he did not know, but
daily and nightly he made prayers to the mediators
of the spirit land, and hoped in his heart that the god
of his people prove not akin to the jealous god of the
men of iron;&ndash;&ndash;for a jealous god would, without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
doubt, take her from him! Against men he could
protect her&ndash;&ndash;but if the gods awoke&ndash;&ndash;and were
jealous&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>And he remembered the fastings, and the penance,
and the prayers by which he had, unknown to all
others, dedicated his life to the gods alone!</p>
<p>But of this he said no word&ndash;&ndash;only held her more
close in his thoughts&ndash;&ndash;but ever a gray shadow moved
beside him&ndash;&ndash;the shadow of an unknown fear&ndash;&ndash;and
it was the same shadow by which he had been led to
count over the seeds of the sacred growth&ndash;&ndash;that he
be sure it was in his power to make the death sleep
beautiful to her, if the death sleep should shorten
their trail together in the Earth Life.</p>
<p>She knew nothing of his fear, and watched each
lengthening shadow with delight&ndash;&ndash;since the growing
shadows were heralds of his coming! Even the
trembling of the earth was forgotten in that joy&ndash;&ndash;and
she scarcely noted that the air had grown
strangely sultry&ndash;&ndash;almost a thing of weight it seemed;&ndash;&ndash;a
brooding, waiting spirit, silencing even the whisper
of the pines&ndash;&ndash;and the whisper of the pine was
sacred music to the Te-hua people;&ndash;&ndash;through all the
ages it had whispered, until in a good hour it had
given voice to their earth-born god!</p>
<p>She knew not anything of the gods of her own
people, and the ominous silence of the pines meant
not to her what they would mean to a girl of the river
villages. But the magic of the place did make itself
felt to her when her robe, as she touched it, sent out
little snappings as of fireflies&rsquo; wings, and far across the
land tiny flashes flamed from earth to sky as the dusk
grew. When she shook loose her hair that she
might arrange it more pleasing for his sight, she was
startled by the tiny crackling, like finest of twigs in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
blaze&ndash;&ndash;and to smooth it into braids silenced none of
the strange magic;&ndash;&ndash;each time her hand touched it,
the little sparks flashed&ndash;&ndash;under the heavy brooding
atmosphere, electric forces were at work in strange
ways&ndash;&ndash;and on the heights of Pu-y&eacute; they have for
ages been proof of the magic in those mountains.</p>
<p>Therefore is it a place for prayer.</p>
<p>Startled by the strange earth breathings, the girl
crept within the portal for her waiting&ndash;&ndash;and the
dusk was too deep for sight across the rolling land
of ancient field, and pi&ntilde;on wood far below.</p>
<p>Had she kept the watch she might have seen more
than one figure approach the heights from different
ways&ndash;&ndash;only a glimpse could be had, but through
the dusk of pi&ntilde;on groves certainly two figures moved
together, a man and a woman, and even before them
one man stole alone from the south, and halted often
as if to plan the better way of approach.</p>
<p>The man and woman skirted the foot of the mesa,
and crept upward on the side to the north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the hard way to climb you have come,&rdquo; said
the man, and the strange heavy air caused them to
stop for breath, and as she reached to cling to the
hand of the man, he drew back with a gasp of terror.
As their hands touched, a little electric shock ran
through each,&ndash;&ndash;it was plain they had reached the domain
where the witch of evil powers held sway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not I whom you need fear,&rdquo; said Yahn
Tsyn-deh,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;it is the witch maid of Tahn-t&eacute;, and we
have come to see the killing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if&ndash;&ndash;if Gonzalvo grows weak on the trail&ndash;&ndash;or
if his men take fear from this evil magic of the
mesa of Pu-y&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No other men come with him&ndash;&ndash;we talked&ndash;&ndash;we
two! Alone he will do it:&ndash;&ndash;for me!&rdquo; she said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
proudly. &ldquo;He knows the strong bow, with it he will
send the arrow first to the man,&ndash;&ndash;that will be when
they stand clear in the moonlight. Then to the
witch:&ndash;&ndash;that all people may see they were near to
each other. The arrows are good and the bow is
good. I saw that it was so;&ndash;&ndash;also I saw that no
man of our people can use it better than can Gonzalvo.
By the river I watched him. He needs no
fire sticks to find the heart of an enemy&ndash;&ndash;alone he
can do it with an arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ka-yemo looked at her sullenly,&ndash;&ndash;she was giving
much of praise to the man she would have him destroy!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you sure that he does not bring the
thunder and lightning stick also?&rdquo; he demanded,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and
how are you sure that it is not used for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;&ndash;fool you!&ndash;&ndash;who make fears out of
shadows&ndash;&ndash;yet are so big to fight!&rdquo; she breathed
softly. &ldquo;Why is it that the Navahu or the other
wild people do not make you fear&ndash;&ndash;yet the Castilians&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are truly men of iron. As a boy I saw
the things they could do,&rdquo; he answered.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Not as
men do I fear them, but it is their strong god who
tames their beasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your arrows are good,&rdquo; said Yahn Tsyn-deh with
conviction,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;when you see him dead as other men
die, you will know that our own gods are also strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dark had fallen heavily, and only the Ancient
Star gleamed threatening as it waited for the moon.
The smaller stars were not seen and the shadows were
very dense.</p>
<p>Because of this a strange thing came to them as
they reached the summit. Strong as was the heart
of Yahn the Apache, she was struck by terror, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
Ka-yemo knew that the great god of the men of iron
had sent a threat for his eyes to see.</p>
<p>For, still and erect against a dark wall of the Lost
Others, stood a man outlined in fire. In Castilian
war dress he stood, and little flickering lines of fire
ran along helmet and breastplate and lance. No
face could they see of the horror, which added to,
rather than lessened the terror of Ka-yemo. A living
face he could meet and fight&ndash;&ndash;but this burning ghost
of a man not yet dead&ndash;&ndash;!</p>
<p>He turned and stumbled downward blindly, and
Yahn Tsyn-deh clung to him and gripped his hand
cruelly for silence, and when they sank at last beside
a great boulder, her arms were around him, as though
that clasp kept the solid world from crumbling beneath
her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;no!&rdquo; muttered Ka-yemo as though
she had actually uttered words of persuasion,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;it is
what their padre said long ago. Their strong god
has an army of saints, and of angels,&ndash;&ndash;they stand
guard;&ndash;&ndash;all who go against them are swept into
the flames of their Underworld! It is what the
Padre Luis said&ndash;&ndash;and now it has been seen by
my eyes! Their altars are the stronger altars,&ndash;&ndash;we
will go there&ndash;&ndash;we will both go;&ndash;&ndash;the fire of
their hell will not reach us at their altar&ndash;&ndash;the medicine
prayers of their padre are strong prayers&ndash;&ndash;we
will go to him&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old fear of his boyhood had enveloped him as
the unchained electric force had enveloped the heights.
Yahn Tsyn-deh put up her hand to her throat;&ndash;&ndash;she
felt herself strangle for breath as she listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was some trick!&rdquo; she insisted&ndash;&ndash;though she
also had trembled with awe&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Listen to me!&ndash;&ndash;they
have many tricks&ndash;&ndash;these white men! Because of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
a trick will you go to their altars, and be shamed in
your clan? Their priest is the head of all things&ndash;&ndash;will
you follow the steps of another when you can
wear the feathers of a leader? Will you be laughed
at by the tribe? Hear&ndash;&ndash;oh hear!&ndash;&ndash;and let your
heart listen! Never again will the gods send you
this chance to be great&ndash;&ndash;this is your day and your
night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their devils keep guard&ndash;&ndash;the flames of their
hell no man can fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ka-yemo!&ndash;&ndash;I am holding you close&ndash;&ndash;I give
myself to you!&ndash;&ndash;one arrow only must you send when
the witch maid is killed, and Tahn-t&eacute; is killed,&ndash;&ndash;one
arrow, and forever you are the highest, and I am your
slave to give you love! Ka-yemo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light of the moon was sending a glow above
Na-im-be mountains. The moon itself was not yet
seen, but enough light was on the mesa for the pleading
girl to see the face of the man she adored.</p>
<p>The face was averted and turned from her. In
terror he bent the arrow shafts across his knee, and
flung the bow far down into the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ka-yemo!</i>&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she moaned as the last vestige of
her idol was destroyed by his own hand;&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;do you
give me then to the Castilian? Must <i>I</i> pay the
debt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against the gods of their hell I will not send
arrows,&rdquo; he muttered&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;He may not claim you&ndash;&ndash;the
sign sent to me here is a strong sign&ndash;&ndash;a god of
fire is a strong god&ndash;&ndash;and I am only a man! It may
be that if we go to their padre&ndash;&ndash;and if we
confess&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could see that he was blindly groping in his
mind for some chance&ndash;&ndash;some little chance, to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
forgiven&ndash;&ndash;to be forgiven by the Castilians whose
feet would be on his neck&ndash;&ndash;and on hers!</p>
<p>It was his day and his night, and he had thrown it
away! Never again could the day dawn in joy for
those two.</p>
<p>She drew him to her as the light grew, and looked
in the face she had loved from babyhood. It was a
long look, and a strange one. She was thinking of
the archer above them who waited to send death to a
man and a maid!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked as her fingers slipped from
his shoulder along his arm and clasped his hand with
the closeness, the firmness of settled resolve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is that you have chosen,&rdquo; she said quietly.
&ldquo;It is the right of the man to choose;&ndash;&ndash;and it will
be well. It is the right of the woman to follow: and
before the moon comes again from the blanket of the
east we will know&ndash;&ndash;and the gods will know, that the
choice is a good choice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held his hand and led him upwards;&ndash;&ndash;steadily,
yet without haste. The edge of the moon showed
red, and the moon was to be clear of the mountains
when Tahn-t&eacute; came to the portal of the star&ndash;&ndash;thus
had his mother told the girl while Yahn listened like
a coiled snake close to the well.</p>
<p>To Ka-yemo, Yahn seemed again the adoring
creature of love. She held him close, and whispered
endearing things. Never had Yahn, the Apache
tigress, let him see how completely her love could
make her gentle and make him master. The sweetness
of it, and the absolute relief when the arrows
were destroyed&ndash;&ndash;gave him a sense of security;&ndash;&ndash;It
would be easy to confess to the padre;&ndash;&ndash;the Castilians
would be glad of converts&ndash;&ndash;and Juan Gonzalvo&ndash;&ndash;someway
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
they could make words to Juan
Gonzalvo&ndash;&ndash;and padre would help&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Holding closely his hand she led him up the ancient
stairway, and the little doorways of the cliff dwellings
showed black, for the moon had slipped above the
far hills and shone, a dulled ball of fire through the
sultry haze. Enough light it threw on the white
cliffs to show any moving creature, and Ka-yemo
glanced fearfully towards the portal of the star, for
surely a movement was there!</p>
<p>But Yahn Tsyn-deh at the head of the stairway
looked straight ahead where a man with a strong bow
held himself close in the shadow of a great rock.
When the twang of the bow string sounded, she
loosened not her hand from that of Ka-yemo as he
fell, but with her other hand she pulled aside the robe
from her breast&ndash;&ndash;also the necklace of the white
metal, that not anything turn aside the point of the
arrow which was to follow.</p>
<p>And when it came she fell to her knees, and then
over the huddled body of the man she had loved and
led to death.</p>
<p>She loosened not her hand, and only once she
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a good choice,&rdquo; she whispered, but he had
led the way into the Twilight Land&ndash;&ndash;and she followed
as she had said was the right of a woman.</p>
<p>And the clan of Ka-yemo could chant songs of
bravery all their days and not know that Yahn the
Apache had saved the pride of her father&rsquo;s people,
and had hidden the weakness of Ka-yemo on the
heights of Pu-y&eacute;!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE CALL OF THE ANCIENT STAR</h3>
</div>
<p>When the moon had scarce reached the
center of the sky, a gray faced man slipped
through the corn fields of the river lands,
and spoke to the Spanish sentry who paced before the
dwellings where the camp was made outside the wall.</p>
<p>The sentry wondered who the woman was who had
held him belated, for many were now coming from
Shufinne, and some of them were pretty.</p>
<p>But Capitan Gonzalvo laid himself down to dream
of no woman. He crept to the pallet of Padre
Vicente. There were no words lest others be
aroused, but a pressure of a hand was enough to bring
the padre to his feet, the sleep of the man was ever
light as that of one who does sentry duty day time and
night time.</p>
<p>Out into the open of the summer night they both
passed, and in the shadow of a wall where the Te-hua
sentinel could not see, a man of iron broke down
and half sobbed a confession of horror.</p>
<p>The padre paced to and fro in the dusk of the
night, and gave not over much care to the shaken
heart of the penitent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred Aves, and half as many rosaries,&ndash;&ndash;and
candles for the altar of San Juan when we return
to Mexico.&rdquo; He tabulated the penance on his
fingers, with his mind clearly not on those details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take you courage now, and hark to me,&rdquo; he said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
brusquely. &ldquo;You say you saw the maid and the man
dead one on the other;&ndash;&ndash;and that you fled across the
mesa at sight of their faces. That pretty Apache
devil told you that the witch lived at that place, and
that the Po-Ahtun-ho was her lover. How know
you that it was not indeed witchcraft you looked
upon? How know you that the infernal magic was
not used to change the faces of the two that you be
sent home not knowing which are dead and which are
living? This may yet be turned to our advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juan Gonzalvo was past thinking. Not though
gold was found as plentiful as the white stones of Pu-y&eacute;
would he again go to the witch accursed spot! His
own armor had been touched by the fire of hell in that
place until he had lain it aside while he waited for the
coming of the sorcerer, and the sorcerer had in some
way kept hidden&ndash;&ndash;magic spells had been worked to
blind the eyes of Gonzalvo to the faces of the others&ndash;&ndash;even
though light was given for the arrows to speed
true! He would fight living Indians in the open:&ndash;&ndash;but
no more would he trail witches in the dark!</p>
<p>So he mumbled and made prayers and calmed himself
somewhat at sight of the calm, ever cool padre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go you to your rest,&rdquo; said his reverence at last,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and
forget all the work of this night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget?&ndash;&ndash;but they will be found&ndash;&ndash;they&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see that they are found, but let it not trouble
you,&rdquo; stated Padre Vicente. &ldquo;We must meet trickery
by trickery here. Go to your bed, and sleep too sound
for early waking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;how&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;between the shock and fear of
the night, Gonzalvo fairly clung to the quiet strength
of the padre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your sleep:&ndash;&ndash;and keep a still tongue forever!
I have had a dream or a vision this night,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
and the padre smiled grimly. &ldquo;I can as well afford
a vision as can the elect of the Po-Ahtun!&ndash;&ndash;and my
vision will send people of Ka-yemo&rsquo;s clan to search for
dead friends on the heights of Pu-y&eacute;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if they find there also&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; and the padre nodded and smiled that the
thought had penetrated the shocked mind of Capitan
Gonzalvo;&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;If they find there also the evidence
that their high priest is the lover of a witch&ndash;&ndash;and
that he runs from council prayers to meet her in the
night:&ndash;&ndash;is that not the best of all things the saints
could send us? You have done good work for the
cause this night, Juan Gonzalvo. Go now to your
sleep&ndash;&ndash;and when you hear of that which is found on
Pu-y&eacute;, you hear it for the first time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The council of that night had been a late council
because of the quaking of the earth. Every one knew
it was time that a sacrifice be made to the visitor in the
sky. All of evil was coming to the land because this
had not been done. One Yutah slave belonged to the
Quan clan, and a robe and shell beads must be given
by the vote of the council to that clan. It would be a
better thing to use the new Navahu who was made
captive by the men of iron, but their new brothers
would not listen to this wisdom.</p>
<p>When the sun looked over the edge of the mountain
in the new day the sun must see the heart lifted
high;&ndash;&ndash;and the body must go to the murmuring
river&ndash;&ndash;then only could hope come that the evil magic
be lifted from the land of the Te-hua people.</p>
<p>Thus the vote had been, and thus had Tahn-t&eacute; been
held in council long after the time the Moon Mother
came over Ni-am-be mountains.</p>
<p>Don Ruy was at that council, and asked to speak
against the offering of blood to the god whose eye was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
as the star. But Tahn-t&eacute; listened and then spoke,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your own god of the book asks for sacrifice&ndash;&ndash;your
god of the book accepted his own son as a sacrifice&ndash;&ndash;and
that people prospered! Your priests
teach the blood atonement, and the death they gave
the earth-born god was a hard death&ndash;&ndash;if he had
really died there! Being a god he could not die in
that way;&ndash;&ndash;all medicine men who know strong magic
know that. But the blood was spilled and the spirit
went away from that place&ndash;&ndash;the earth gods always
go away like that while they are young;&ndash;&ndash;never do
they die. There are days&ndash;&ndash;and there are nights,
when they come back! They speak in many ways to
earth people. You men of iron do not to-day make
blood sacrifice to your gods;&ndash;&ndash;so you say! Yet your
people go out to battle and kill many people for your
god&ndash;&ndash;also many of your own people are killed in
such god wars&ndash;&ndash;your tribes of different names call
these wars &lsquo;holy&rsquo;. Our people do not think like
that. Even the wild tribes hold the Great Mystery
sacred in their hearts. They will fight for hunting
ground, or to steal women or corn&ndash;&ndash;but to fight
about the gods would bring evil magic on the land&ndash;&ndash;the
old men could not be taught that it is a good thing!
Also your Holy Office has the torch, and the rack, and
the long death of torture for the man who cannot believe.
The priests of your jealous god do that work,
and their magic is strong over men. You talk against
our altars, but on our altars there is not torture,&ndash;&ndash;there
is one quick pain&ndash;&ndash;and the door of the Twilight
Land is open and the spirit is loose! This world
where we live is a very ancient world, but it is not yet
finished. All the old men can tell you that. It may
be in the unborn days that earth creatures may see the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
world when it finished,&ndash;&ndash;and when the gods come
back, and speak in the sunlight to men. In that time
the sacrifice may be a different sacrifice. But in this
time we follow the ancient way for the gods have not
shown us a different way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have studied much in books&ndash;&ndash;you have
learned much from men,&rdquo; said Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;You
could change the minds of these people in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; looked kindly on him, but shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the ages of ten men can you change the
mind of the men you called Indian,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in my
one life I could not make them see this as you see it&ndash;&ndash;yet
am I called strong among them. Also I could not
tell them that the way of the white priest when he
breaks the bones in torture until the breath goes, is a
better way than to take the heart quickly for the god!
That would be a lie if I said it, and true magic does
not come to the man who knows that he is himself a
teller of lies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men of the council went their separate ways to
sleep in the kivas, well content that the angry god was
to be appeased at the rising of the sun,&ndash;&ndash;and Don
Ruy rolled himself in his blanket and lay near the door
where Ysobel and her husband lived apart from the
camp, with only the secretary inside their walls. But
Don Ruy slept little&ndash;&ndash;and cursed the heathenish
logic of Tahn-t&eacute;, and wished him to the devil.</p>
<p>And stealthily as a serpent in the grasses,&ndash;&ndash;or a
panther in the hills, Tahn-t&eacute; sped from the council of
sacrifice, to the hills where he knew a girl had waited
long for his coming.</p>
<p>Little thought gave he to trailers. The night before
had been the night of the scalp dance&ndash;&ndash;and
now the trembling earth, and the council, had left the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
men weary for the rest of sleep. He ran swiftly and
steadily in the open as any courier to Shufinne might
run.</p>
<p>But those of the Tain-tsain clan who followed,
noted that he did not go to Shufinne,&ndash;&ndash;he climbed instead
the steeps where they were to climb, and for that
reason their coming was stealthy, and the cleverest
men were sent ahead, and all said prayers and cast
prayer meal to the gods,&ndash;&ndash;for this was a strange
thing the white priest had seen in a vision&ndash;&ndash;it was
to be proven if he was of the prophets!</p>
<p>The two couriers of the clan knew it was proven
when they saw the two dead people near the head of
the stone stairway. And when they heard the sobs of
a woman within the dwelling of the Reader of the
Stars in the ancient days&ndash;&ndash;also the soothing tones
of a man,&ndash;&ndash;they crept back into the shadows and told
the leaders. And a circle of men was made about the
place, and in silence they waited.</p>
<p>Ere their hearts had ceased to beat quickly from
the run, that which they waited for stepped forth;&ndash;&ndash;a
man to whom a creature clung&ndash;&ndash;her face was
hidden against his breast, and he led her with care lest
she see the dead people on the stairway&ndash;&ndash;for the
Navahu shrinks more than another from sight or
touch of the dead!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are other places&ndash;&ndash;and safe places,&rdquo; he
said to her and held her close. &ldquo;Does not the bluebird
find nesting place in the forest? And does not
her mate find her there in the summer nights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then&ndash;&ndash;with his arms around her, and his
robe covering her, his path was closed by a warrior
who stood before him! His eyes turned quickly on
every side, but on every side was a circle of men,&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
the men were all of the clan of Ka-yemo to whom
Tahn-t&eacute; had never been precious since the days of boyhood&ndash;&ndash;and
the camp of Coronado.</p>
<p>And the younger men were for claiming the maid
when they saw her face, and the older men read
triumph against Tahn-t&eacute; for the work of this night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That which is meant for the gods is not to be
given to men,&rdquo; they said in chiding to the young men,
and Tahn-t&eacute; knew what they meant when they said it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Navahu witch maid of Te-gat-ha,&rdquo; cried
another&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;look&ndash;&ndash;brothers! This is a Navahu
arrow through the eye of Ka-yemo, and through the
heart of Yahn Tsyn-deh. Alone here she has destroyed
them!&ndash;&ndash;and alone here would Tahn-t&eacute; the
Po-Ahtun-ho have cherished her! The priest of the
men of iron is a man of strong magic. His vision
has sent us to find the one who has made angry the
gods of our land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go you and gather pine for the altar,&rdquo; said the
head of the clan, and two youths ran joyously down
the slope;&ndash;&ndash;for they were to aid in driving evil
magic from the valley!</p>
<p>&ldquo;This maid did not touch those dead people,&rdquo; said
Tahn-t&eacute;,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;for that she must not suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Summer people are easily held by witches&rsquo;
craft,&rdquo; retorted one of the men insolently,&ndash;&ndash;a day
before he would only have addressed Tahn-t&eacute; with
reverence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she not marked for sacrifice at Te-gat-ha?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Has
she not caused the killing of the corn?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Did not the Navahu men come to destroy us because
of her?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is the earth not angry that she has
hidden in the sacred places?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These questions came thick and fast for Tahn-t&eacute;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
to answer, and Tahn-t&eacute; held her hand and knew there
was no answer to be made. And Phent-zha, who
was the oldest man there, looked at him keenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you also not more weak in magic for her
coming,&rdquo; he asked,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;is your heart not grown sick?
The magic of the white priest is against you;&ndash;&ndash;and it
is strong! When we have taken the heart from this
witch, and you have again fasted in the hills, the sick
land and the sick people will be made better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid looked from face to face in the glare of
freshly lit torches, and caught little of meaning from
the rapid speech. But no one touched her, and she
looked with confidence into the eyes of Tahn-t&eacute;. He
had not moved from his tracks, and he held himself
proudly as he faced the man who had long wished his
humiliation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the time comes to fast in the hills, I will
know it,&rdquo; he said,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and no hand touches the heart
of this maid, but&ndash;&ndash;my own!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is at sunrise,&rdquo; said the governor, stilled by the
look of the Po-Ahtun-ho&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;a runner has been sent&ndash;&ndash;the
council will be waiting for the enchantress, and
the women to prepare her will be waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will lead her,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute; and took her hand,
and from the medicine pouch he took one bead of the
by-otle, and in Navahu he bade her eat of it in secret,
which she did wonderingly, and the men of the Tain-tsain
clan walked before and after them and held
torches, and they went down the steep of Pu-y&eacute; before
the moon had touched the pines of the western hills.
And a runner was sent to Shufinne that the people
there might come and put Yahn Tsyn-deh and her
lover under the earth together.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>&ldquo;AT THE TRAIL&rsquo;S END!&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<p>The morning stars were shining through the
gray threatening sky, when a slender blanket
draped figure stepped from Ysobel&rsquo;s doorway
into the dusk, and came near putting foot on Don
Ruy Sandoval who lay there as if on guard.</p>
<p>There was a little gasp, and the blanket was
clutched more closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Excellency!&rdquo; breathed Chico wonderingly&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;awake
so early&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake so late,&rdquo; amended his excellency,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and
is this not a good place to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth I am having doubts of my own,&rdquo; confessed
the secretary with attempted lightness.
&ldquo;What with barbaric battles, and earth quakings,&ndash;&ndash;and
a night when the breath of volcanoes seemed
abroad in the land and strange lightenings came up
from the earth&ndash;&ndash;it suggests no dreams of paradise!
Don Diego thinks it is because the expedition has not
been more eager for souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he not converted S&auml;h-pah and won a ladylove?&rdquo;
asked Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;he is at least that much
in advance of the rest of us. I&rsquo;ve had no luck, and
you are as much of a bachelor as ever you were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chico contemplated the morning star in silence, and
Don Ruy smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the enchanted ring of Se&ntilde;or Ariosta should
fall at your feet from yon star;&ndash;&ndash;or the lamp of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
Alladin would come out of the earth in one of these
quakings, what would you ask it to do with us all,
since this camp is not to your liking?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would wish you safe in Mexico with no sorcerer
to doctor your wounds if you were bent on acquiring
such pleasures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No learned professor could have brought healing
more quickly,&rdquo; contended Don Ruy,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and the sorcerer,
if so he be, has given me food for thought at
least. Which reminds me that you are not to go to
the river mesa this morning in case you see the barbarians
trooping that way for ceremonies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A runner came panting past them from towards the
hills, and the gate was opened for him and closed
again, and a herald from the terrace shouted aloud
sentences arousing all who yet slept;&ndash;&ndash;not only arousing
them, but causing unexpected shrieks and cries
of consternation from many dwellings. There were
the lamentations of the old women of the Tain-tsain
clan, and their wails sent the thrill of a mysterious
dread through the night that was dying, for the day
had not yet come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it&ndash;&ndash;what?&rdquo; asked the secretary in a
whisper of dread. &ldquo;You know what the thing is;&ndash;&ndash;tell
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so nice a thing that you should trade a convent
garden for it,&rdquo; confessed Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;if the
wishing ring were mine you would be wafted there before
that star goes pale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and the secretary strove to assume a
lightness not to be honestly felt in that chorus of
wails. &ldquo;You would make me a messenger to your
lady of the tryst&ndash;&ndash;and I would tell her that since luck
with the pagan maids has not been to your fancy, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
may please to walk past her balcony and again cast
an eye in that direction!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at the same time you might whisper to her
that I would not now need to glance at her the second
time to know her,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Even the armor of
a Bradamante could not mask her eyes, or dull for me
the music of her voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a most strange place to make words for the
wooing of a lady, is it not?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;asked Don Ruy looking
up at the slender form wrapped in the blanket.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;But
new worlds are in making when earth quakes
come,&ndash;&ndash;and our to-morrows may be strange ones, and&ndash;&ndash;sweetheart
comrade, I have lain at your door each
night since your head rested on my shoulder there in
the arroyo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Someway Don Ruy made his arm long enough to
reach the blanket and draw the hesitating figure to
him, and rested his cheek against the russet sandals,
and then a very limp Master Chico was on the ground
beside him, and was hearing all the messages any lady
of any balcony would like Love to send her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot forgive you letting me carry all that
water for a fainting fit&ndash;&ndash;and there was no fainting
fit!&rdquo; she protested at last,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;all these days I&rsquo;ve lived
in terror;&ndash;&ndash;not quite certain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you nothing of the uncertain weeks you
have given me?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he retorted.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I had my puzzled
moments I do assure you! And now that I
think of it&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m in love with a lady whose actual
name I have not been told!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we not equal in that?&rdquo; she whispered, and he
laughed and held her close as a bandaged throat
would allow.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ruy Sandoval is a good enough name to go to
the priest with,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if &lsquo;Do&ntilde;a Bradamante&rsquo;
has no other I&rsquo;ll give her one if she&rsquo;ll take
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite the Indian grandmother, and the madness
of longing for life in the open&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Viceroy and court of Spain to boot!&rdquo; he
declared recklessly. &ldquo;Sweetheart, I must have the
right to guard you in a new way if need be, for these
are strange days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even while they spoke the stars were shot over by
the green light of a promised dawn, and against the
faint sky line of the mesa a strange procession came.
Men carrying long fringes of the cedar such as grow
in the moist places in the ca&ntilde;ons,&ndash;&ndash;also festoons of
the ground pine, and flowers of the sun with the brilliant
petals like warm rays.</p>
<p>The bearers of these ran swiftly, but the others
moved more steadily, and Don Ruy called to Jos&eacute;
to learn for him the meanings of things, and why
Tahn-t&eacute;, the Ruler, walked like that as if in prayer,
and clasped hands with a girl who smiled up in his
face as a child on a holiday, though all the older
men looked as though walking to battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the witch maid who has brought evil magic
on the land,&rdquo; said Jos&eacute;, who had heard the herald&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;also
she has enchanted the Po-Ahtun-ho with
devil&rsquo;s arts, and has killed Yahn Tsyn-deh and Ka-ye-mo
with Navahu arrows on Pu-y&eacute;. They say she
laughs to show that no knife can harm her, and she
goes to the altar instead of the Yutah;&ndash;&ndash;for it is
she the earth groaned for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;said Don Ruy to his lately claimed
&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Bradamante&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;keep within the house with
Ysobel until we come again. There may be much to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
do, Lady mine, but there are no records for you to
keep this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And without protest or reply he was obeyed.
There was something so awful in the sight of the
smiling maid of the bluebird wing, and the wails of
the women who mourned those she had destroyed,
that one would willingly flee the sight of their meeting.</p>
<p>But the Te-hua guards closed around the enchantress
and the fanatics of vengeance were barred out.
Those meant for the Mesa of the Hearts were not to
be given to people!</p>
<p>Publicly the governor made thanks to the priest of
the men of iron;&ndash;&ndash;he it was who had smelled out
the witch&ndash;&ndash;and sent the men where her dead was
found! Plain it was that their white brothers helped
in magic and in battle. Let the old men think wisely
and well before they let such brothers go from the
land. For the angry gods, and the quaking earth,
the priest of the beard had found the cause;&ndash;&ndash;also
the cure had he found. Did not the sun symbol belong
to this man for this work? Let the old men
think well of this thing!</p>
<p>Don Ruy held Jos&eacute; at his side, and listened, and
hearing all, he faced the padre with the first anger
they had seen in his reckless kindly eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For your own ends of the gold search you have
done this thing?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;To a death on
the altar have you sent that child-woman? Good
priest of the church, you make a man wonder if the
saints indeed listen, and God is above!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;&ndash;impious!&rdquo; groaned Don Diego, and
crossed himself in horror. &ldquo;Oh Excellency&ndash;&ndash;your
words are apostate&ndash;&ndash;unsay them and tempt not Almighty
Power!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span></div>
<p>The padre turned pale with anger and shut his
teeth close under the dark beard. But he was not a
coward, and the habit of domination through special
privileges was a habit of many years, and it served
him against the merely temporal power of even regal
influences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the witch creature I gave them no word,&rdquo; he
said&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;it was their thrice accursed sorcerer they
were sent in search of. But the two belong to each
other, and the old men of the order know now that
their high priest is in league with devils. Never
again will he be the Ruler. His power is overthrown.
He cannot save even his own witch-mate
from the vengeance of the clans. The thing we have
crossed these deserts for will be given to us since his
voice against us is silenced. Is that a thing to regret,
Excellency? I thought it was for this we made entrance
to the land&ndash;&ndash;and for this you joined hands
for the expedition!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had recovered his ease of manner, and even a
mocking tone crept into the final words. Don Ruy
looked around the faces of the Castilians and Mexicans
and saw no more of special emotion in the light
of the gray dawn than they had shown at the dance
of the scalps in the glow of torches so few hours ago.</p>
<p>To them all it was only a witch being led to death,
and they had seen that same thing in Christian lands.
It was not a thing for special wonder,&ndash;&ndash;except that
this sorceress was young, and that she looked at the
young Indian Ruler, and smiled often, and little
sounds like a mere murmur of a song came sometimes
from her lips.</p>

<p>The guard shrank away from her as she began.
The Navahu captive who had been long a slave, said
it was the song of the Dawn, and that it was the last
song of many songs which were part of the wonderful
&ldquo;Night Chant&rdquo; ceremony of his people,&ndash;&ndash;it was a
ceremony to heal all things of the ills of life.</p>
<p>But despite his words the Te-hua men shrank away,
and the Te-hua women had trembling hands as they
stripped her, and crowned her with the sacred pine,
and fastened around her a girdle of the feathery
young cedar, and in the green of the crown they
thrust the golden disks of the flowers of the sun.
She lifted the lion skin from the ground and held it
close as a garment, and stood alone against the terrace
wall. The people shrank and half feared to
look at her lest the Dawn song be a witch charm to
enchant them.</p>
<p>Po-tzah had brought to Tahn-t&eacute; the white robe of
the priest who makes sacrifice, and a long knife of
white flint for which the sheath was softest of deerskin,
and the symbols painted on it were those of the
Father Sun and Mother Moon.</p>
<p>And while the maid held close the garment he had
given her, and chanted her Dawn song dreamily,
Tahn-t&eacute; lifted from the ground the wing of the bluebird
tossed aside by the medicine women who made
her ready for the sacrifice, and he placed it in the
white band about his own head so that he wore two
instead of one, and then he lifted his voice and spoke,
and no other sound was heard but his voice, and the
low song of the witch maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men of Te-hua,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I speak not you
will not know the truth;&ndash;&ndash;and it may be that you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
will live many days ere you believe this truth! The
maid who has come down from the hills is not a
stranger to Povi-whah&ndash;&ndash;and has done no evil. The
daughter of K[=a]-ye-fah is this maid. She is K[=a]-ye-povi,
the child who was lost. All you people know
of the years of the grieving of her father who was
strong for that which was good. His child has come
back to find her own people. On the trail she was
lost, and evil magic of the men of iron have made
hard your hearts when she came to you. I have
waited until all the people were here to listen. Now
I speak. To speak at Pu-y&eacute; to the clan of Tain-tsain
would not have been wise. They were sent by the
vision of the white priest to find a witch woman. It
is the child of K[=a]-ye-fah they find, and instead of glad
hearts, and glad speech, she is given by the Te-hua
people only the crown of the sacred pine. Let her
own clan of the Towa Toan speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thrill of wonder ran through the crowd, but no
kind faces were there, and Tahn-t&eacute; took from his
medicine pouch the last seed of the sacred medicine
given to man by the gods. There had been many
seeds when they left Pu-y&eacute;. He knew he was daring
the gods, and that the penalty would be heavy. But
her fearless face, and the music of her Dawn song
was payment for much.</p>
<p>And to the gods he would answer!</p>
<p>The gray dawn was gone, and the green dawn was
merging into the yellow where the stars are lost.</p>
<p>The head of the Towa Toan clan spoke from a
terrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have heard the words of Tahn-t&eacute;. The
witch maid is not known by our people, and our clan
does not claim her! By evil magic has the song of
this maid blinded the eyes of Tahn-t&eacute;,&ndash;&ndash;and by evil
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
magic will she make desolate the land if she is let
live. The white priest has strong medicine&ndash;&ndash;and
good medicine of the gods. The men of Te-gat-ha
and the men of Navahu knew her as a witch, and
sought her. They did not find her because the men
of iron were not their brothers. To us they are
brothers. I give thanks, and we think they should
have that which they seek with us. Their priest
works also for our god, and the symbol of the god is
not to be hidden from him. Also the altar waits;&ndash;&ndash;and
the stars are going away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; touched the hand of the maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said gently, and as he touched her
hand, he gave to her the last seed from the fruit of
the sacred plant,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;eat for the trail you must walk
over, and sing for me alone the song holy of the
Navahu Sun God; I take you to meet him on the
Mesa of the Hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ruy tried to press through the guard, but the
orders of the heads of the clans had been strong
orders. The Castilian brothers might follow; but
the stars were going away, and there was no time for
words after the crown was made. The flowers must
not wither above a living face.</p>
<p>And the maid entered the canoe with the Po-Ahtun-ho
and the Te-hua boatmen plied the paddles
so that the crossing was quick, and all the others
followed, and some men swam, and the Castilian
horses and riders went also. And a second priest of
the Po-Ahtun went with a white robe, and a good
knife in his girdle. Tahn-t&eacute; was called &ldquo;sorcerer&rdquo;
by the wise men of iron, and it was best to trust not
entirely to the heart of a sorcerer. He was plainly
bewitched, and his heart might grow weak when he
looked on the altar, and looked on the maid!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></div>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; pointed to the upturned face of the God-Maid
on the bosom of the south mesa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my altar to you all the days of my boyhood,&rdquo;
he said softly, &ldquo;there I met the god thoughts;
there were the serpents tamed. It is the God-Maid
of this valley and her face is ever to the sun. To her
was my love given while I waited for your face!
Listen!&ndash;&ndash;and know this is so&ndash;&ndash;and sing now the
song of the Sun God and the earth&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With her eyes on his she chanted the words, and the
Te-hua oarsmen dared not look on her face for very
terror. The words they did not know&ndash;&ndash;but no victim
had ever yet gone singing to that altar.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;<i>In my thoughts I approach&ndash;&ndash;I approach!<br />
The Sun God approaches,<br />
Earth&rsquo;s end he approaches.<br />

The beautiful trail.<br />
In my thoughts I approach&ndash;&ndash;I approach!<br />
The Moon God approaches<br />
Earth&rsquo;s end he approaches&ndash;&ndash;</i>&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The canoe touched the shore, and the maid clasped
the hand of Tahn-t&eacute; and went over the sand lightly
as a child who wanders through flower fields to a
festival. He looked in her eyes and knew that the
magic of the sacred seed was strong, and that the
hand of no man could hurt her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your trail is to the hills,&rdquo; he said.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;To the
heart of the forest you go. Where the bluebird
builds her nest&ndash;&ndash;there you build the nest where
we meet again. You see your wings in my hair?
I wear both of them that they lead me again to your
trail when the time comes. When the bluebird calls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
to her mate, I will hear your voice in that call.
When the anger of the gods has passed, I will find
you again in the Light beyond the light at the trail&rsquo;s
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the trail&rsquo;s end,&rdquo; she said as a child repeats a
lesson&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I build the nest for you, and sing the bluebird
song for you at the trail&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to the gods that it will be so,&rdquo; he said,
and sprinkled prayer meal to the four ways.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;The
Spirit People stand witness! The gods will be good
in that Afterworld;&ndash;&ndash;I will find you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the edge of the mesa&ndash;&ndash;and the
pale yellow of the sky had been covered with a weird
murky red. For all the many followers, a strange
hush was on the height, and far in the south low
thunder was heard. The same still, heavy air of the
night was brooding over the world, and long rays of
copper and dull red were flung like banners to the
zenith. Each man&rsquo;s eyes looked strange questions
into the eyes of his neighbor, and the Te-hua men
came not close to the witch maid, and the man at the
altar.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;<i>The Sun God approaches&ndash;&ndash;approaches!<br />
Earth&rsquo;s end he approaches!</i>&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>They could hear the low chant of her witch song,
and they could see Tahn-t&eacute; offer prayer meal to the
Spirit People of the four ways, and to the upper and
the nether world. At his word she laid herself on
the rock, and no other priest was asked to help, or to
hold her, and that was a sacrifice such as had never
been seen in that place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No hand but mine shall touch you:&ndash;&ndash;O Bird of
my Wilderness!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Light beyond the light I wait for you at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
the trail&rsquo;s end,&rdquo; she said, and laughed that his hand
rested on her breast.</p>
<p>And the sun, blood red, came over the edge of the
world, and Don Ruy cried aloud at the lifted hand
of Tahn-t&eacute;, and the gleam of the white flint knife.</p>
<p>But the guard closed in, and one of his own men
caught him, and asked for pardon afterwards, and
when he could again see the altar, the knife was red,
and a heart was held outward to the sun that looked
like the flame of burning worlds.</p>
<p>And a long, shivering, high keyed chant of the
Te-hua people went upwards to the sky, that the gods
might know they were witness. But in the midst of
it the rumbling as of thunder was under their feet and
the earth rocked. Sulphurous fumes came upwards
from the long closed crevices of the solitary mesa;
and to the south there was the crash as of falling
worlds, and the great mesa of The Face lifted before
their eyes, and settled again as a wave of the river
lifts and breaks on the shore.</p>
<p>The chant of the sacrifice was silenced on their
lips, and they fled downward at that sight, for the face
of the God-Maid of the mesa no longer looked upwards
to the sun! The outline of the brow, and the
cheek, and the dainty woman&rsquo;s chin they could still
see;&ndash;&ndash;but the face was turned from them&ndash;&ndash;turned
toward the south&ndash;&ndash;where the gods have ever gone
in an evil season!</p>
<p>And only Don Ruy Sandoval saw the heart put
back in the breast of the witch maid, and saw her
wrapped in the white robe of the Po-Ahtun-ho, and
saw the crevice where the Powers of the Underworld
had opened a grave for her there on the Mesa of the
Hearts.</p>
<p>And even he watched afar off; for there was that in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
the face of the Indian priest not to be understood by
the white man who felt both pity and horror.</p>
<p>But he waited at the foot of the mesa, and held the
canoe while the Po-Ahtun-ho, who had the logic of a
white man, but the heart of an Indian, came down
and entered it in silence, and as they crossed the river,
stared as though scarcely seeing it, at The Face now
turned southwards on the mesa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;loved her?&rdquo; said Don Ruy at last and
something of the tone of a lover in the voice made
Tahn-t&eacute; close his eyes for a moment, and then look
at the Castilian. He did not need to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet&ndash;&ndash;you could do&ndash;&ndash;<i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the gods are angered against earth people,
it is always the most precious they demand in sacrifice,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;When we make vows, the gods
watch that we keep the vows&ndash;&ndash;else we pay, Se&ntilde;or,&ndash;&ndash;we
pay&ndash;&ndash;we pay!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE PROPHECY OF TAHN-T&Eacute;</h3>
</div>
<p>Vague tremblings were still felt underfoot;
the river was red with the clay of fallen
banks. Smoke came from an ancient crater
to the south, and also the east, and above the Mesa
of the Hearts hung a cloud of volcanic dust, or a puff
of smoke escaped from the red ash-covered fissures of
the Underworld.</p>
<p>The women were gathered in terror in the court,
but fled at the sight of Tahn-t&eacute;. The anger of the
earth was a thing of fear; but he was made see that
there were worse things, and they covered the faces of
their children that his eyes might not rest on them.</p>
<p>At the door of the council house he paused and Don
Ruy beside him. There was much talk. All the
leading men were there, also Padre Vicente and Don
Diego. They entered and there was silence.</p>
<p>No one offered to Tahn-t&eacute; the pipe, and no one
spoke to him.</p>
<p>The priest of the New God had told them things&ndash;&ndash;he
knew men&rsquo;s hearts&ndash;&ndash;he had confessed so many!&ndash;&ndash;He
told them it was love for the witch maid by
which the hand of the sorcerer kept every other man
from touching her.&ndash;&ndash;Even to take the heart from her
breast, was an easier thing than to give her to the men
of Te-gat-ha or of Povi-whah, who had looked on her
face and asked for her, also he had wrapped about her
his priestly robe of office before he laid her in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
earth where Satan had broken the rock to reach for
her!</p>
<p>Their sorcerer had traded his robe of office for the
evil love of an enchantress:&ndash;&ndash;never again must a
god be offended by sound of his prayers!</p>
<p>And no one offered him the pipe, and no one spoke
to him. He sat alone and looked with unseeing eyes
at the weeping god on the altar.</p>
<p>Padre Vicente was seated in a place of honor. He
looked at Tahn-t&eacute; across the circle, and it was plain
that the ways had changed since that other day of
council when they had looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes,
and the pagan had been the Ruler!</p>
<p>The right hand man of the governor arose. He
was the oldest man, and he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the earth has trembled we have talked&ndash;&ndash;and
the trembling has grown little while we talked,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;It is plain that the gods have sent these
signs that we may know our white brothers are indeed
of the sun, and the symbol of the sun should be given
to their keeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another man arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also these new brothers will guard our fields from
the Navahu and the Apache,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We will
have the tamed animals to ride, and our enemies will
run before the fire sticks our brothers will give us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The governor arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their god we are asked to take, and the god will
do much for us if the sun symbol is given to their
keeping. To us that seems good. The keepers of
the sun symbol are two, and must be only two. Let
it be for the ancients of the Po-Ahtun to say which
man of their order gives up the secret, and makes
medicine to forget it was ever in his keeping.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></div>
<p>A man of the Po-Ahtun stood up and looked at
Tahn-t&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man and a woman hold that secret of the
symbol of the god,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In our own kiva must
that be spoken of, and not in another place. But the
hearts of our people are gentle towards our new
brothers who smell out witches, and do not mate with
them! Our order will surely make medicine that the
priest of the great king be given that secret to keep
for us, and the Sun God will smile again on our
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well&ndash;&ndash;it is very well,&rdquo; said all the council.
And then there was a long silence, and they looked at
Tahn-t&eacute; until he arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not except I die for you, will you believe;&ndash;&ndash;and
even then you will not believe,&rdquo; he said in sadness.
&ldquo;You, my people, will accept the god of the
gold hunters, and you will not see that it is only riches
they want at your hands! In other years you will see.
When the men of Te-hua work in chains for the men
of Spain&ndash;&ndash;and for the masters of the men of Spain!&ndash;&ndash;Then
in that day will the men of Te-hua tell to
their sons these words&ndash;&ndash;the words of the prophecy
of Tahn-t&eacute;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are much troubled, and our hearts are sad,&rdquo;
said Po-tzah. &ldquo;The magic of the white god is
strong&ndash;&ndash;and their priest has let our people see that
it is strong. We do not want that magic against our
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against your children will the magic come in the
unborn years!&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute; with decision. &ldquo;You
will take the god of the white man because one more
god, or one more baptism hurts no man. You will be
trapped by fair words until I see the time when you
can circle in the half of a day all the fields you dare
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
plant for your own! The Flute of the Gods will be
silenced in the land. Your Te-hua daughters will be
slaves for the men of the iron! The sacred places
will be feeding lands for their animals. The Te-hua
priests will wait the word of the white man ere they
dare go to the groves of the sacred trees for the
prayer wreaths to the gods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sacred pine must be sacred to all&ndash;&ndash;always!&rdquo;
said Po-tzah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not anything is sacred to the white men&ndash;&ndash;I
have looked in their books;&ndash;&ndash;I, of all Te-hua
men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Padre Vicente saw that the old magic of the talking
leaves was potent;&ndash;&ndash;and he arose without waiting
for formal interpretation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has looked in the books with the eyes of a
sorcerer!&rdquo; he declared, thus openly accusing Tahn-t&eacute;
before the council.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;He has read crooked things&ndash;&ndash;and
his words are the words of the man who mated
with the witch in the hills!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The council stared at this new sign that strong
magic was with the priest of the robe&ndash;&ndash;he was suddenly
given knowledge of the tongue of Te-hua!
Don Diego stared in wonder and crossed himself
many times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a language infernal even to the people born
to it,&rdquo; he gasped&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but that it should be given to
one of us on the day when we are openly claimed as
brothers is a special sign of grace. Thanks to the
saints who sent it your way instead of mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man has brought evil on you until the earth
groans and turns,&rdquo; continued the Padre. &ldquo;His
mother of the caves is called &lsquo;holy&rsquo; and he is called
strong in the light of the sky:&ndash;&ndash;But the sky is angry,
and the Great God and his saints are angry that this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
sorcerer has cheated you so long with enchantments
of the devil! Be strong for the saving of your own
souls, and leave him to his witch mates and to his
hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Don Ruy was astounded that the padre addressed
the council in their own words&ndash;&ndash;truly of
all priests ever frocked he had found the one most
subtle for the work in hand, for having gained the
council&ndash;&ndash;as it was easy to see he had gained them&ndash;&ndash;Padre
Vicente spoke in Castilian to Tahn-t&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet does my office exact absolution for you, if
you but crave it with a contrite heart,&rdquo; he said for the
benefit of Don Ruy and Don Diego who listened.
&ldquo;You have worked for your devils, and they have
deserted you, and stripped you of power. Acknowledge
the true God and the saints will intercede for
your favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; looked at him, and his smile was strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a man named Judas in your holy
book,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;only silver did he crave for his
work. You are greater than Judas; you work for the
metal more precious. Is it thirty pieces you want ere
you crucify me utterly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure of a woman darkened the entrance&ndash;&ndash;a
slender fragile figure who moved to him swiftly,
and noted no others in the dusk of the council house.
In Shufinne the word had reached her of the horror
of Pu-y&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;and she had come quickly as might be, and
the sound of his living voice drew her breathless, but
thankful to his side, and his arm circled her in support
and in tenderness as he looked over her head to the
Te-hua men of the council.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see your thoughts, and I read them,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;The men who seek the gold have put a wall between
you and me. That which you have you can give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
them;&ndash;&ndash;but remember in your hearts that there are
things which belong to the unborn, and such things
you have no power to give them.  Only so long as you
keep your own religion, and your own gods, so long
will your tribe stand as a tribe;&ndash;&ndash;no longer! Step
by step your children will have to fight the strangers
for that which is now your own. Only your god-thoughts
will bind you as brothers;&ndash;&ndash;the god of the
gold hunters will poison your blood, and will divide
your clans, and will divide your children, until your
names are forgotten in the land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sorcerer who tells you this is the brother to
the serpents in the Desert!&rdquo; said Padre Vicente
springing to his feet in angry impatience;&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;enough
of words have been said of this&ndash;&ndash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sound between a scream and a moan silenced the
words on his lips, and Don Ruy felt his blood run
chill, as the drooping figure of the Woman of the
Twilight stood suddenly upright with lifted hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teo!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she murmured in utter gladness,&ndash;&ndash;and
moved through the half light of the room towards the
Castilians. &ldquo;Teo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy God!&rdquo; whispered Don Ruy, while the
padre turned white. Don Diego stared in horror&ndash;&ndash;only
one named Teo came in his mind&ndash;&ndash;the
Greek who should belong to the Holy Office in Seville;&ndash;&ndash;the
man whose word even now was wanted
as to the older days of Christian slave trade in Europe!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Teo!&rdquo; she was quite close to him now, and
she spoke as a trembling child who craves welcome,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;Mo-wa-th&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;speak!
O Spirit;&ndash;&ndash;you have
come back from the Star&ndash;&ndash;you have come&ndash;&ndash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Te-hua men, and Tahn-t&eacute; also, waited in
wonder. Never before had the Twilight Woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
gone like that to a man&ndash;&ndash;and she was so close that
the man shrank from her against the wall of the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he muttered, and he spoke Te-hua
now, and his voice was rough with rage and fear,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;This
woman is evil, and brings evil power!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is the Woman of the Twilight&ndash;&ndash;the holy
woman of the caves,&rdquo; said a man of the Po-Ahtun, for
Tahn-t&eacute; could find no words for the wonder she
wakened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is an enchantress who fights against the true
god and his angels;&ndash;&ndash;a witch of evil magic!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and
the padre was white, and breathing hard lest she
touch him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A witch!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she echoed in horror.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I?&ndash;&ndash;Teo&ndash;&ndash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She crept to him in abject supplication and reached
out her hand, touching the sleeve of his robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he shouted in horror&ndash;&ndash;and held the
crucifix between them&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Thing of the Evil One!
May your tongue be palsied&ndash;&ndash;may your magic fail&ndash;&ndash;may&ndash;&ndash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; hurled him aside, and caught his mother as
she fell; and the padre leaned half fainting against
the wall, with great beads of sweat standing on his
face, and the crucifix still lifted as a barrier or as a
threat.</p>
<p>But the threat was useless to the slender creature of
the caves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teo&ndash;&ndash;Teo!&rdquo; she whispered, and then
&ldquo;Tahn-t&eacute;,&rdquo; and then the breath went, and her son laid
her gently on the floor, while the padre regarded <i>him</i>
with a new horror! Don Ruy watching them both,
choked back an oath at the revelation in the white
face.</p>

<p>The Te-hua men also drew away;&ndash;&ndash;even Po-tzah
averted his face when Tahn-t&eacute; looked from one to the
other!</p>
<p>Again had their eyes seen the strength of the white
medicine god. The holy Woman of the Twilight
had been destroyed before their eyes. It was the
greatest magic they had yet seen!</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute; saw it, and knew it; and felt as he had felt
when a boy, and he had stood alone and apart&ndash;&ndash;the
only child of the sky. He had come again into his
own! He was akin to none of earth&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>Then the man of the Po-Ahtun spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two there were who held the secret of the sun
symbol;&ndash;&ndash;Now there is only one,&ndash;&ndash;she has taken it
through the Twilight Land to the Light beyond the
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;said Don Ruy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and this woman
was one? And the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one spoke, but Tahn-t&eacute; looked at him; and
again there was no need for words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Medicine can be made to make a man forget,&rdquo;
said Tahn-t&eacute; to the men of Te-hua&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but no medicine
can be made to make a man remember! One
keeper of the secret is dead by the magic of the white
priest. Your children&rsquo;s children will give thanks in
the days to come that it was not given to the men of
iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a secret of the tribe!&rdquo; protested the man of
the Po-Ahtun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now the secret of the god who hid it in the
earth,&rdquo; said Tahn-t&eacute;. &ldquo;By all earth people who
knew it&ndash;&ndash;it has been forgotten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;without it we will lose our brothers of the
new god!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without it you will surely lose your brothers of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
the new god!&rdquo; he assented. &ldquo;Each time you look on
the God-Maid of the mesa who has turned away her
face, you will remember the prophecies of Tahn-t&eacute;!
Each time the God of Young Winter paints leaves
yellow for the sleep to come, your children will see a
sign on the mountain to tell them that Tahn-t&eacute; was
indeed Brother to the Serpent as that man said in his
mocking!&ndash;&ndash;also that the prayers of Tahn-t&eacute; do not
end. Free I came from the Desert to you, and I
carried the Flute of the Gods, and fruit for your
children:&ndash;&ndash;free I go out from your dwellings and
carry my &lsquo;witch mother&rsquo; to rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gathered her in his arms, and looked once into
the pallid face of her accuser and destroyer. At that
look from the pagan priest the white priest shrank
and covered his face with the cowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;go?&rdquo; said Po-tzah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the place of Povi-whah another will hear your
prayers to the gods, and I&ndash;&ndash;Tahn-t&eacute; the outcast&ndash;&ndash;I
go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No more words were spoken among the men of the
council. In silence they watched him as he walked
with his burden up the trail of the mesa where he had
run so gladly to make his boy vow at the shrine.</p>
<p>No happy sign shone for him this time in the
sky. It was as he said to Don Ruy;&ndash;&ndash;those who
make vows to the gods,&ndash;&ndash;and forget them for earth
people, pay&ndash;&ndash;and pay prices that are heavy! But
above him a bird swept into the golden sky. He
put up his hand to the wings in his hair&ndash;&ndash;and
heard plainly the words of the mate who would wait
his call at the trail&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>And Don Ruy Sandoval watched the man called
&ldquo;sorcerer&rdquo; out of sight, and then went to the
dwelling of Jos&eacute; and gathered to his breast
the secretary who had adopted blanket draperies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sweetheart comrade,&rdquo; he said without proper prelude
or preparation&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;There is not anything in this
weary world worth living for but Love, and Love
alone. Shall we take the homeward journey and go
where we can guard it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are tears in your eyes,&rdquo; said his &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a
Bradamante,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and you look as if you make love to
me, yet think of some other thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen a man live through hell this day,&rdquo; he
answered. &ldquo;Never ask me, Sweetheart&ndash;&ndash;what the
hell was. It is beyond belief that a man could live it,
and continue to live after it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE BLUEBIRD&rsquo;S CALL</h3>
</div>
<p>Even in the long after years in stately Christian
Spain, Don Ruy was a silent man when
his serene lady in stiff brocades and jewelled
shoes would mock at court pageantry and sigh for the
reckless days when she had worn the trappings of a
page and followed his steps into the north land of
barbaric mysteries.</p>
<p>Mystery much of it had remained for her! The
life of the final days in the terraced village by the
great river had been masked and cloaked for her.
Ysobel and Jos&eacute; had been silent guards, and Don Ruy
could not be cajoled into speech!</p>
<p>But there had been a morning he suddenly became
a very compelling commander for all of them; and
his will was that the cavalcade head for the south and
Mexico as quickly as might be, and that Padre Vicente
de Bernaldez separate from them all and seek converts
where he would. A horse and food was allowed
to him, but no other thing.</p>
<p>Don Diego exclaimed with amazement at such arrangement,
and warned Don Ruy that the saints
above, and Mother Church in Spain, would demand
account for such act on the part of even Don Ruy
Sandoval!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it indeed so?&rdquo; asked Don Ruy, and smiled
with a bitter meaning as he looked on the padre:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Will
you, se&ntilde;or priest, tell this company it is at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
your own will and request that you remain in this land
of the barbarians? Or is your mind changed, and
do you fancy Seville as a pleasant place for a
journey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Padre Vicente turned the color of a corpse, and
said openly before them all, that he asked freedom
to journey to other Indian villages. Thus, white and
silent he was let go. He went without farewell. If
he found other villages none can tell, but the men of a
great Order framed before the building of the Egyptian
pyramids, do know that the traces of a like Order
is to-day in one of the villages of that province of
New Spain, and that there is legend of a white priest
who lived in their terraces of the mesa, and taught
them certain things of the strange outside world so
long as they let him live. But his name is not remembered
by men.</p>
<p>What Don Ruy Sandoval said to the Viceroy of
Mexico on his return, was in private conference, but
a royal galleon carried him, and carried a strangely
found Mexic bride, across the wide seas to Spain,
where the wonderful &ldquo;Relaciones&rdquo; were made the
subject of much converse, but never printed, and during
the lifetime of the adventurer called Ruy Sandoval,
the province of New Spain along the Rio Grande del
Norte was locked and barred against the seeker of
gold or of souls&ndash;&ndash;it was the closed land of mystery:&ndash;&ndash;the
province of sorcerers, where Mother Earth hid
beneath her heart the symbol of the Sun Father.</p>
<p>But there are legends there in the valley of the Te-hua
people to tell of that time of trial three centuries
ago. Also there are the records written on mesa and
mountain. In the time of that far away, the Spirit
People worked together on Na-im-be Mountain until
of the evergreen pine, a giant figure of a man grew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
there, and around him is growing the white limbs and
yellow leaves of the aspen groves. The hands of
that figure reach high overhead and are to the south,
and they hold the great Serpent whose body is as a
strung bow in its arch, and whose head is high on the
hill where the enchanted lake, known by every one,
reflects the sky. Tahn-t&eacute;, whose mother was the
Woman of the Twilight, said the God of Winter
would send a sign that the people might know the
ancient worship of the creeping Brother was a true
thing&ndash;&ndash;and so it was done&ndash;&ndash;all men can see it when
the Spirit People turn yellow the leaves.</p>
<p>Other things spoken by him have come true until
the Te-hua priests know that one born of a god did
once live among them as a boy and as a man.</p>
<p>Like children bewildered did the clans of Povi-whah
watch the silent swift departure of their white
brothers from whom they had hoped much. They
thought of many things and had trouble thoughts
while they waited until the mourning of Tahn-t&eacute; in
the hills would be over, and he would come again to
their councils. But when the waiting had been so
long that fear touched their hearts, then men of the
highest medicine sought for him in the hills, that his
fasts be not too long, and he be entreated to return:&ndash;&ndash;that
turned-away face of the God-Maid on the mesa
made their hearts weak, and they needed the strong
prayers of Tahn-t&eacute;. His name meant the Sunlight,
and their minds were in shadow after his going away.</p>
<p>With prayer words and prayer music they sought
for him, and sacred pollen was wafted to the four
ways, and all the ways of the Spirit, that the help of
the Lost Others might come also.</p>
<p>They told each other of the promise of Po-se-yemo
and of Ki-pah, that in each time of stress a leader
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
who was god-sent would come to the Te-hua people
so long as they were faithful to the Things of the
Spirit.</p>
<p>This had truly been a season of stress, and an appeal
of new, strange gods!</p>
<p>Tahn-t&eacute;, the leader, had been born and had come
to them; the Flute of the Ancient Gods he had carried
as the Sign!&ndash;&ndash;and as they whispered it to each other,
their eyes had a new terror, and they sought wildly
for reasons to justify themselves.</p>
<p>He had come. They had choice, and they chose
the new white brothers, and the new god promises!</p>
<p>He had come;&ndash;&ndash;and they had closed their hearts
against his words&ndash;&ndash;they had driven him away as
in other days the Ancient Fathers had driven Po-se-yemo
to the south:&ndash;&ndash;for the gods only live where
the hearts of men are true, and strong, and of faith!</p>
<p>These things they had been told by the Ancients,
but they remembered it now anew as they followed
each other in silence to the hills, and to the white
walls of Pu-y&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;and to the tomb there newly built
that the Woman of the Twilight might rest where
her people had lived in the lost centuries.</p>
<p>The portal of it was closed, and the sign of her
order was cut in the rock at the portal.</p>
<p>The priests made many prayers, but no trace of the
lost Ruler could they find. All was silence in that
place of the dead, but for the song of a bluebird
flitting from one ancient dwelling to another.</p>
<p>Younger men went far to the west where the
people of the Hopi mesas had loved him;&ndash;&ndash;somewhere
in the world he must be found!</p>
<p>But the Hopi people mourned also, for they had
heard the strange call of a flute across the sands in the
night time, and had feared to answer to the call, and in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
the morning there was no sound of the flute, and no
priest of the flute to be found:&ndash;&ndash;only a trail across
the desert sand&ndash;&ndash;and the trail led the way of the sun
trail, and the Winds of the Four Ways blew, and
swept it from sight&ndash;&ndash;and they knew in their hearts
that Tahn-t&eacute; had sent his good-bye call ere he went
from the land of men to the land of gods.</p>
<p>They knew also that he went alive&ndash;&ndash;for the god-born
do not die.</p>
<p>This word the couriers took back to the Te-hua
people of the Rio Grande, and fires were lit for him
as they have been lighted for centuries that the god
Po-se-yemo might know that their faith in the valley
of the great river was yet strong for the ancient gods.</p>
<p>Three centuries of the religion of the white
strangers have not made dim the signal fires to those
born of the sky!</p>
<p>The walls of Povi-whah have melted again into
Mother Earth. Silent are the groves where the
Ancient Others carved their homes from the rock
walls of the heights. Wings of vivid blue flit in the
sunlight from the portal of the star to bough of the
pi&ntilde;on tree&ndash;&ndash;and a brooding silence rests over those
high levels;&ndash;&ndash;only the wind whispers in the pines,
and the old Indians point to the bird of azure and tell
of a Demon-maid who came once from the land of
the Navahu, and wore such wings, and sang a song of
the blue bird, and enchanted a god-born one with her
promise to build a nest and wait for him&ndash;&ndash;at the
trail&rsquo;s end!</p>
<p>An ancient teller of Te-hua legends will add that
the trail of Tahn-t&eacute; was covered by the sands of the
Four Ways and no living people ever again looked
on his face,&ndash;&ndash;and that the Te-hua priests say the
strong god of the men of iron swept him into the
Nothing because he alone stood against the new faith
in that time of trial.</p>

<p>The teller of tales does not know if this be true
or not&ndash;&ndash;all gods can be made strong by people, and
it is not good to battle against the god of a strong
people:&ndash;&ndash;they can send strange sorceries and wild
temptings, and the Navahu maid had such charm she
was never forgotten by men who looked upon her
face. It is also well known that the bluebird is a
sacred bird for medicine, and does call at every
dawn on those heights, and the wings worn in the
banda of Tahn-t&eacute; might, through strong love, have
become a true charm;&ndash;&ndash;and might have led him at
last to the nest of the witch maid in some wilderness
of the Far Away;&ndash;&ndash;who can tell?</p>
<p>But all men know that the prophecies of Tahn-t&eacute;
are true to-day in the valley of the Rio Grande&ndash;&ndash;and
that his vision was the vision of that which was
to be.</p>
